# Artisan Items

Artisan items are special items with custom names, descriptions, stat modifiers, and often enchantments that can be bought from [[Runic Blacksmith|Runic Blacksmiths]] or one of their variants. They serve as upgraded versions of vanilla gear, and often come in full sets sold by the same Runic Blacksmith. Their descriptions often provide lore surrounding the area in which the Blacksmith is found.

Artisan items are denoted by a yellow "Artisan" text in their item description.

## Artisan Armor Sets

At [official towns](/World/Settlements/Official_Towns/), Runic Blacksmiths sell complete sets of artisan armor, which provides a uniform stat boost for each piece worn. These artisan sets vary in quality and material based on how far in the game they are meant to be accessed. Towns closer to the center of the map generally sell weaker armor sets (chainmail or iron), while the furthest towns sell enhanced diamond artisan armor sets, which require Runic Amplifiers to purchase.

A list of artisan sets and their stat bonuses is found in the dropdown table below.

#### Coiled Nail

In version 2.2.2, an upgrade to the Nail was added, known as the Coiled Nail. It is also sold by the Runic Nailsmith, tied in to a very small structure elsewhere in the region which some players mistook for a puzzle, but did not have an interaction prior to this version.

??? question "Pale Ore Location"
    The Pale Ore is obtained as a reward for an environmental puzzle in the Frozen Bite, below the Grimm Troupe and just to the south. A small altar holds four pillars with signs labeled "MAGNIFY".
    ??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
        The puzzle is quite simple. Remove the chiseled stone brick above the glass in the center of the structure, allowing the glass to act as a magnifying glass for light above. The central obsidian block will be destroyed, revealing the Pale Ore. <br>
        Pale Ore lore text: *A small and odd-looking metal that is unusually heavy.*

[^1]: Comes from the term "tetrodotoxin," the neurotoxin most closely associated with pufferfish.
[^2]: Prior to the 2.2.2 update, this set's description was different, reading: "Blessed with potentia second only to rehntite's, lapis lazuli is far softer and easier to use. In a land where rehntite was never found, it is uniquely precious." This was changed due to a conflict with the description of the [[Crystal Digging Claws]], which asserts that a different material, mendarum, is actually the second highest-potentia material.
