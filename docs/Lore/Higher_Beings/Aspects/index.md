# Aspects

The Aspects are draconic gods that predate the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/), being responsible for much of the early history of the realm. In the modern era, however, their influence is very rarely felt.

## Creation

The first Aspects—the [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/)—were created directly by the [[Primal Tree]], likely before the nominal start of the First Avihm. The first Aspects were the Elder (or "Great") Aspects, who represented extremely important, fundamental parts of the physical world, and helped to create those pieces of the physical world. These were [[Taihgel]], the Aspect of Land, [[Rihelma]], the Aspect of Sky, [[Dahr]], the Aspect of Sea, and [[Khive]], the Aspect of Magic. Together, they made the fundamental physical matter of the Av1 world. The other four Major Aspects, coming in two pairs, were created by the Tree afterwards to add more detail to the world: [[Lai]] and [[Loe]], Aspects of Warmth and Cold, as well as [[Vayniklah]] and [[Voynahla]], Aspects of Life and Death.

### Children/Reproduction

The Minor Aspects are, for the most part, not direct creations of the Primal Tree. Rather, they are children of the existing Major Aspects. It appears that the Aspects are capable of asexual reproduction, simply excising their children from themselves. One in-game source suggests that in doing so, the parent Aspects forget what they know about the details of their child's domain, passing that knowledge fully along to the child.

Child Aspects' domains are therefore derivative of their parents. The three Emotion Aspects are children of [[Khive]], dealing with matters of the soul. [[Dahroehl]], Aspect of Freshwater, comes from Dahr, while the Wind Aspect [[Rihalae]] comes from Rihelma, and so on.

There are two instances of child Aspects having parentage from two different Aspects, and it seems unlikely that this comes from a sexual relationship. These two examples are [[Palaesida]], the Aspect of Storms who was born of both Dahr and Rihelma, and the Aspect of Harvest, [[Noha]], born of a mix between Taihgel and Vayniklah.

It is stated in [[Relics#Resplendence|Vayniklah's +3 relic]] that she was the first to create the first of the Minor Aspects, done so that more specialized Aspects could help her with "designing viable vessels for souls". This likely means that [[Mari]], Aspect of Drehmari, and [[Muhs]], Aspect of Beasts, were the first of the Minor Aspects.

## Appearance

Aspects vary in physical appearance, but they are all described as being reptilian or draconic in some way, although some significantly stretch this definition. Many incorporate parts from different real-life and fictional animals, almost always associated with the domains that they govern.

Aspects are, for the most part, much larger than [[Drehmari]] or other humanoids, although this also varies greatly by individual. Some Aspects, such as [[Nahyn]], are much smaller than the others, possibly even smaller than a Drehmari, while the largest such as [[Noha]] were almost the size of small towns. 

## Activity

Each of the Aspects is believed to have had a massive hand in creating their respective part of the natural world: [[Taihgel]] created the world's initial landforms, [[Mari]] helped to design the Drehmari form, [[Dahr]] created the oceans, and so on. This was true of the world in the First Avihm, but after the [[Felling]] and the birth of the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/), [[Drehmal]] took on the Herculean task of completely rebuilding and reshaping the world. Today, it is unclear how much of the natural world was made directly by the Aspects, and how much was Drehmal's own creation.

The Aspects are believed to have once been extremely active on the [[disc]], living among the mortal Drehmari, but since early Av2, they have gradually moved to the moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]]. The reasoning for this is not entirely clear, although it seems that some of them have been scarred by negative interactions with mortals, including whatever mysterious events led up to the Felling.

Following the events of the [[Divine Schism]], most of the Aspects became reclusive, realizing that they could die and fearing that they would be killed by their brethren just like [[Palaesida]]. The death of [[Muhs]] shortly thereafter was the final nail in the coffin for most Aspects, with very few spending any time on Drehmal since late Av2. 

It is unclear to what extent the Aspects are all necessary for the continued function of the world, long after taking part in its original creation. There are some clear effects to the death of Aspects, as seen in the late game, and some Aspects, such as the Emotion trio, are still said to manage their respective emotion within the Drehmari population.

The Aspects and Deities together make up the **Prismatic Council**, the official governing body of the divine moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]].

[^1]: Aspects' gender is extrapolated from the pronouns used to refer to them in-game, which are canon. M = Masculine, F = Feminine, N = Neither/Nonbinary
[^2]: References to Dahroehl typically alternate between both use of masculine and feminine pronouns, implying that the Aspect is genderfluid.
