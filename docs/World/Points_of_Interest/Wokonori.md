![[wokonori.png]]

**Wokonori** is a ruined, abandoned cliff dwelling in northern [[Grand Pike Canyon]]. The home to an incredibly ancient, lost civilization, Wokonori also contains the [[devotion]] site of the long-dormant Land Aspect, [[Taihgel]]. It can be found near the ground level, along the north-central cliff face.

## Layout

Wokonori stretches from west to east along the bottom of the cliff face, made up of several interconnected small buildings. It can be roughly divided into a western and eastern half, by a small bridge and stream. Its buildings are primarily made of a mixture of sandstone and red sandstone, with additional red, brown, and yellow terracotta from the surrounding landscape.

A series of mineshafts in the west leads to the [[Artifacts#Stoneshaper|Stoneshaper]] artifact.

Taihgel's shrine is located at the bottom of a spiral staircase leading down from the western side.

## Taihgel Devotion Guide

Taihgel's small underground shrine is littered with low-level offerings, including flint, quartz, and magma blocks. To discover higher-tier offerings, players will need to read the hint book, [[Ancient Earthen Text]], which reads: 

> We, the devout, mine the **taihryte**, sacred to Taihgel, deep under this town, and **bury our desires within its ancient, formless red marbled stone, which burns within and burns without, if ignited, shall burn forever**, may our offerings be incorporated into the virgin stone, the first stone, and may the land walk again.

This points to higher-tier offerings buried in small taihryte (netherrack) deposits throughout Wokonori.

Like all other devotion sites, a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] can be found here. This relic vessel is particularly hidden, located up the stream that divides Wokonori and in a hidden diorite cave.

## Lore

Wokonori is an incredibly ancient settlement, stated by its advancement to have been ancient even in the time of [[Avsohm]], likely meaning it originated from late Av1 or very early Av2. Its inhabitants were worshippers of the trio of [[Taihgel]], [[Nahyn]], and [[Koh]]—the Aspects of Land, Mountains, and Stone, respectively. The lore text of the Stoneshaper artifact states that the people of the town saw themselves as "custodians of the earth gods' great gift".

While its age is not explicitly stated in the map, developer comments assert that the town actually predates the [[Felling]], and that the people of Wokonori managed to survive the transition from Av1 to Av2. This same account states that the people of Wokonori had a thriving oral history, but that this history, and their culture, did not survive the post-Felling years.

## Extras

Wokonori draws heavy inspiration from real-life Puebloan cliff dwellings, such as [Cliff Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cliff_Palace) in Mesa Verde National Park.
