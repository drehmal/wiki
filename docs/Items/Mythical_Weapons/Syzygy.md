**Syzygy** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

An incredibly powerful crossbow with a draconic or shark-like mouth, Syzygy is found through a unique questline, entirely contained to the moon of [[Lo'Dahr]]. It was the weapon of a legendary [[Tehrmari]] figure who served as the servant of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/).

Syzygy is a crossbow with heavy NBT modifications.

Syzygy is extremely powerful and is often used in addition to a player's melee weapon of choice. It can be used in either a very mobile or a more stationary tank build, due to the versatility its special ability offers. It deals 20 damage with a normal shot, and up to 100 with its special ability.

The weapon's special ability, Draconitic Rebuke, allows the player to press their swap-to-offhand key ("F" by default) while standing still to enter sniper mode. In this mode, the player can charge up an extremely powerful shot, which must be charged and fired while laying relatively still. This ability then goes on cooldown for 20 seconds.

Syzygy comes with the Quick Charge I enchantment, and can support further crossbow enchantments such as higher levels of Quick Charge or Piercing.

## How to Obtain
Syzygy is obtained through a unique questline on [[Lo'Dahr]], as the player must complete 6 discrete trials scattered throughout the divine moon in order to secure passage to the crossbow's location. These six trials can be completed in any order, and each one individually gives the player a unique item (either a Legendary or an Artifact) as well as one of the [[The Facets|Facets]].

### Trial 1
Trial 1 is located at the [[Mystic Gallery]] in [[Khive's Domain]] to the west, and is a puzzle involving the structures found around a small pyramid and throughout the domain. It rewards the player with the [[Stasis Bolts]] legendary item, as well as the [[The Facets#Facet I|first Facet]].

### Trial 2
Trial 2 is located at the [[Star-Rise Orrery]] in [[Rihelma's Domain]], and tasks the player with finding six differences between a large room and its reflection. It rewards the player with the "As Foretold" artifact, a strong diamond helmet, and the [[The Facets#Facet II|second Facet]].

### Trial 3
Trial 3 is located at the [[Hypogean Labyrinth]] in [[Nahyn's Domain]], and tasks the player with the completion and recollection of a maze. It rewards the player with the "Composition No. 9,782,813" artifact, a strong pair of diamond boots, and the [[The Facets#Facet III|third Facet]].

### Trial 4
Trial 4 is located at the [[Abyssal Rise]] in [[Dahr's Domain]], and tasks the player with finding and returning six of [[Dahr]]'s pearls. It rewards the player with the "Pearlessence" artifact, a diamond chestplate, and the [[The Facets#Facet IV|fourth Facet]].

### Trial 5
Trial 5 is located at the [[Brightwyrm's Caldarium]] in [[Lai's Domain]], and tasks the player with navigating through a lava-filled room. It rewards the player with the "Blaze-Blessed Breeches" artifact, a unique pair of diamond leggings, and the [[The Facets#Facet V|fifth Facet]].

### Trial 6
Trial 6 is located at the [[Temple of Life]] in [[Vayniklah's Domain]], and offers the player a puzzle based on the location's scenery. It rewards the player with the [[Eldermead]] legendary item, and [[The Facets#Facet VI|sixth Facet]].

### Yriel's Sanctuary
After all 6 trials have been completed, the player will receive the following message in chat:

> "Congratulations Aspirant. Seek the chapel beneath the domed meeting hall in Ytaj to claim your prize."

> Syzygy as it initially appears in-game.

Beneath the Prismatic Council room in [[Ytaj]], in the room with a mural of the Aspects and Deities in a tree, the player will then be able to find a portal. This portal leads to [[Yriel's Sanctuary]], a hidden livable area which serves as the resting place of [[Yriel]]. A short bridge leads to a golden shrine, where Syzygy can be found and picked up by right-clicking.

## Lore
Syzygy was the weapon of [[Yriel|Yriel Rezhad]], the Moonsworn, servant of the Aspects. The Aspects had a relatively strict policy of non-interference in mortal affairs, but ultimately still found themselves in need of a more indirect means of controlling the populaces of Drehmal and Lo'Dahr alike. They enlisted Yriel as their servant, and effectively their one-person secret police force, with this weapon as their primary means of carrying out the Aspects' will.

Yriel used Syzygy many times over the course of their servitude, which appears to have lasted several centuries, but it fell out of use when Yriel was slain by [[Vahid]] at the [[Battle for Drehmal]]. Since that day hundreds of years ago, the Aspects have sought a new aspirant worthy of the weapon, and made it the reward for the completion of the Trials.
