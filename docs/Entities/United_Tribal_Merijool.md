**United Tribal Merijool** (Unofficial Name) was a period in time after the Deity War when [[Merijool]] was peacefully united. Various Merian tribes joined together in a loose confederation. During this period, three major cities began to emerge. In addition, differences between the East and West began to emerge, leading to the eventual disunion of the two halves. This disunion would form two kingdoms: West Merijool and East Merijool, split by the Great Merijool River.
