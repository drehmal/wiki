## Transcription
> Not to worry, lads.
>
> I've left to go get some more of that good stuff. Rumor has it that Mama Vuxli's really outdone herself with this new batch.
>
> Listen, I need some of you to keep a lookout on the bridge while others scan the waters below. I don’t want to come back from the little old village in the heart of our swamp to see you lot cuffed and hogtied by a Talon patrol or eaten by the wildlife. All goes well, I’ll have a barrel for us by this evening.
