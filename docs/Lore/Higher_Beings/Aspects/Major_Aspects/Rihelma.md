# Rihelma

**Rihelma** is the Aspect of Sky, and one of the four Elder Aspects alongside [[Khive]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]]. In addition to her dominion over the skies, Rihelma has uniquely potent powers of foresight, being able to commune with outside forces and create prophecies out of the futures that she sees.

## Description

Rihelma's passage in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Star-Rise Drake Rihelma, Great Sky Aspect
> ***
> Rihelma created the skies, the clouds, and most things above our heads. She keeps the moons in their orbits, and is often known to give out enigmatic prophecies in the form of "Facets".

Rihelma is among the wisest of the Aspects, but is very mysterious, and largely keeps to herself.

Rihelma's physical form is a more standard dragon than many of the other Aspects: a two-legged, winged drake.

### Color/Build Scheme

Rihelma is very heavily associated with the color purple, and specifically with amethyst and its in-game block variants. Builds related to Rihelma also frequently reference the [celestial bodies](/Lore/Realm_of_Drehmal/Celestial_Bodies/) of the realm in some way, either through murals that depict the moons and disc or even a proper, full orrery. These builds also sometimes make use of a night sky-esque pattern, made up of black concrete and specks of white.

## Role & Powers

Rihelma holds the powers of the sky itself, including its celestial bodies. Whether part of her domain as the Aspect of Sky or a skill that she picked up, Rihelma is also able to commune with beings beyond the [[Veil]]. It is rumored that other entities outside of this realm come to Rihelma for guidance, and in turn, she occasionally acts as an oracle to the people of Drehmal.

## History

Rihelma is one of the four Elder Aspects, the first Aspects made by the [[Primal Tree]] to build the fundamental parts of the world. As the Aspect of Sky, her job in creating the physical world was to make the sky and the objects within it, setting the moons in their orbits. It is unclear if Rihelma was actually responsible for the creation of these celestial bodies, as the [[disc]] was largely the work of the Tree itself and [[Taihgel]] and [[LD|Lo'Dahr]] was created by [[Dahr]], but she likely had a role in constructing some of the others.

During the [[Divine Schism]], Rihelma fought on the anti-Palaesidan side, battling against her two children.

Rihelma has spent most of her life between [[LD|Lo'Dahr]] and [[Lo'Veruhkt]], being the only known Aspect (or being at all, for that matter) to reside on the latter. Rihelma was said to travel to the Hidden Moon when she wanted to commune with those beyond the Veil, presumably receiving her prophecies while on Lo'Veruhkt. Due to her association with the Hidden Moon, she was worshipped to some extent by the people of [[Veruhkt Plateau]], although it is unclear where else on Drehmal she had significant followers.

Rihelma's most clearly outline act came at the dawn of the Fourth Avihm, shortly after the departure of [[Virtuo]]. A group of [[Virmari]] in Dawnspire Bastion on the remote [[Island of Dawn]] were left behind by the Goddess and the Grand Parish, and Rihelma visited them in their moment of despair. Offering them a new life as her Star-Kin, Rihelma converted the Virmari fortress to a group of her own devotees, visiting them occasionally. From their records, we find that Rihelma left permanently for the moon of Lo'Veruhkt around the centennial of Virtuo's departure, almost the exact date that the player's journey starts. She reportedly cited great turmoil in the near future, and has not been heard from since.

Rihelma's final [[relics|relic]] states the following:

> Star-rise Drake Rihelma, in her deep meditative state upon the moon out of sight, has come to a realization. She is close, closer than any of us could imagine, to true enlightenment. Soon she will blossom and reality shall form around her.

It is completely unknown what this means.

## Devotion Guide

Rihelma's [[devotion]] site is [[Star-Rise Bastion]], a hilltop fortification in the eastern [[Island of Dawn]].

Rihelma's shrine is located on the upper floor of the bastion, overlooking the sea to the north of the island. Around it are scattered low-level devotion offerings: copper ingots, feathers, and truesight (spectral) arrows. The hint book nearby, [[Crystalline Refractions]], reads:

> Shortly after the Abandonment and our Celestial Rebirth, the Goddess of the Endless Sky began to speak to us in prophecy. **Star-crowned crystals** erupted all around the island, and **within** were images of Truth. We must acquire the depicted objects to appease our great-winged Mistress!

Crystals throughout the island, which have extra special swirling patterns around them, contain higher-tier offerings.

Increasing devotion to Rihelma gives players the following rewards. Of note, Rihelma is the only god in the devotion system who has more than 10 devotion reward levels, requiring slightly more offerings to reach max devotion.

Rihelma is unique among the gods in that she does not have one singular [[relics|relic]] which upgrades over the course of her devotion path. Rather, she has four variations on a [[Relics#Rihelma Mirrors|set of mirrors]], which give different status effects to fired arrows when held.

## Late-Game Info

--8<-- "LD_spoiler.md"

Rihelma has a very strong presence on [[Lo'Dahr]], being one of the most important Aspects. 

In [[Ytaj]], a large tower to the east is dedicated to Rihelma, filled with murals representing the night sky and celestial bodies. A large statue of her form, depicting her wings as the night sky itself, is also found to the southeast, pictured below.

![[ytaj_statue_rihelma.png]]

[[Rihelma's Domain]] in the far southeast is possibly the largest of any Aspect Domains on the moon, containing three clear sub-regions. This includes the fabled mountain of Aldregakar—the Star-Rise itself—in the southeastern corner of the moon's habitable area. This region is home to the Avsohmic [[Resupply Depot]], Rihelma's trial at the [[Star-Rise Orrery]], and the [[Augural Tangle]], where Rihelma spent most of her time on Lo'Dahr.

Rihelma's legendary prophecies, the Facets, are also found on Lo'Dahr, scattered throughout the moon as rewards for completing trials. There are seven in total, all found on [[The Facets|this page]].
