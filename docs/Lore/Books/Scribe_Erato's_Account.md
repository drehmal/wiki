### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in [[Teiruun Monastery]]. It describes a scribe in the monastery hearing loud clanking sounds late at night, likely referencing some kind of experimentation going on at the facility.

### Transcription:
> There it was again! I am unabashedly, unambiguously unapologetic! My eyes might be failing me, but my ears are still as sharp as a Tehrmian fieldmouse!
>
> There was definitely a very loud "clanking" noise from somewhere in this building again in the middle of the night.
>
> Monk Sehva says I have nothing to worry about, but I just need to document this phenomenon when I hear it! I might not have access to the Restricted section of the library like Abbot Balthysar and his inner circle, but I am still a scholar and a caretaker of this monastery. My prayers go out to the Abbot for his safety and resilience, wherever he is on this dark and unsettling evening. May She guide his path!
