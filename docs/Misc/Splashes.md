# Splashtexts

Drehmal's resource pack adds over 330 unique splashtexts to the main menu screen (as of 2.2.1), mostly consisting of inside jokes and references to the map and its community. The first version to change the splashes was 2.1, which had 202 unique messages. The majority of these were brainstormed by the community in the weeks leading up to the initial 2.1 release.
