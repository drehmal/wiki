# The Divine Schism

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Divine Schism** was the first and only conflict between the [Aspects](Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), overlapping heavily with the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] on [[[Overworld|Drehmal]].

This conflict led to the some of the only Aspect deaths by the present day, claiming the lives of [[Noha]], [[Palaesida]], and (indirectly) [[Voynahla]], as well as resulting in the indefinite exile of [[Maen]].
