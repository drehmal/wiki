## Transcription
> Our memories fade. Every single one - no matter how cherished, loved, or valuable - will eventually leave our consciousness. Fight all you like, write as many diaries as you want, but we all lose eventually. The images and movies replay over and over in our heads with small and subtle changes until they are no longer recognizable. And some memories fade away without even that.
>
> One type of memory is particularly tricky: feelings. Emotions. The most intangible of all our senses. Those primal forces that stir deep within us are, when separated from their narrative catalyst, even more difficult to remember. After all, you can write in your diary why you made the terrible choices you've made, but what if you don't remember those choices?
>
> Can you imagine? You come across evidence of wrongdoing and can't remember who you were or why you did what you did. The venom within you faded away, but the paralyzed residue remains. The half-faded memory of an emotion is worse than no memory at all. What would you do?
