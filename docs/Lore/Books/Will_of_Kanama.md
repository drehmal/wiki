This book can be found in a chest in the ruins of [[Arkeje]]. It is the last will and testament of Kanama, a follower of [[Voynahla]] who took their own life in order to give their soul to a new vessel in the next life, hopefully one of higher social standing.

## Transcription
> I Kanama, now willingly take my life in honor of the great Aspect of Death, Voynahla. Like my compatriots, I do not see the value of life in a society where some are judged worthy of eternal existence by virtue of talents given by random chance. By sending back my soul, I harbor the fervent hope that it is recycled into a body with an equal chance of finding purpose. To be a Ro'Tehrmari is to be a slave. I give all of my belongings to the next mortal who comes across them. May they prolong your existence until you can make the same decision  I now make.

> Remember Arkeje.
