## Transcription
> We've been working in the Divination Facility for about a year now, and ArkAngel construction was finished about six months ago. Since then we've been slowly and carefully running energy bombardments, incrementally increasing the energy levels until we achieve an energy cascade. It's a slow process, and it's been getting people down recently. Jihv is complaining that she hasn't experienced fresh air or the gentle heat of the Torahn in a year, and Gyl says he misses his family. Slow progress with no results means low morale, but in the end this will all pay off. I know it will.
