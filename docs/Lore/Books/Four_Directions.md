To the north of this ruined city lied the majority of the other governments of Drehmal, predominantly Tharhan kingdoms and Avsohm, who strongly condemned necromancy. The moon of [[Lo'Dahr]] lies in the southern sky. The "hidden sanctuary" to the east references the [[Moonlight Sanctum]]. A hidden underground church in the Moonspires to the west of this town is where the Theocracy originated.

## Transcription
> To be an alchemist of Sal’Lorahn, one must know four directions:
>
> To the North lie the heretical kingdoms, short-sighted and hateful.
>
> To the South lies the Divine Moon, luminous over the endless sea.
>
> To the East lies the hidden sanctuary for which we are grateful.
>
> To the West, through canyons marked by dancing flame, is where we came to be.
