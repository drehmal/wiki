## Layout

Fort Aelon is a large castle, although it has very few significant points of interest within its walls. It stands on top of a mountain, towering over the [[Coven of Alchemists]] to the west, and has large ice spikes stuck through its walls. No Tehrmari inhabitants are found here.

In a ruined library room towards the top of the structure, players will find a lore book tying the fortress to [[Rohei]]: [[A History of the Roheian Empire]].

At the top of the build, a trebuchet sits, angled towards the Coven of Alchemists towards the west. A chest here, at the edge of a chipped balcony to the north, holds a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Agony|Stone of Agony]].

## Lore

Fort Aelon appears to have been a stronghold of [[Rohei]], the first major [[Tehrmari#Ro'Tehrmari|Ro'Tehrmari]] political state, formed of Ro exiled from [[Naharja]]. It is possible that the residents of this castle were wiped out in a purge by the Talon, who may also be responsible for the massive ice spikes in the castle.

The name "Fort Aelon" only appears in the [[Naharja#Art Museum|museum in Naharja]], which has a banner titled "The Wave of Ice at the Siege of Fort Aelon".
