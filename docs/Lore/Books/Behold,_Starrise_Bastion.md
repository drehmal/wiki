> Forsaken by our mistress, how could we go on? As she left us dawned the fourth Avihm, and we all lost our purpose. My brethren became left to wander, aimlessly searching for a purpose. Some could not stand an existence without our Lady of the Mirror, and so they vacated from this existence. We, the Warriors of Dawnspire Bastion, attempted to carry on. As custodians of the last remnant of ancient Virmari civilization, we thought we could hold onto a fragment of our Goddess. Hold out hope that she would return. We dedicated our lives to her, after all. Hundreds of years spent in service of the Goddess of Purity. And yet, abandonment is how she repaid us. We became solemn, fought amongst each other and allowed the Bastion to begin falling into disrepair. We were failures. All seemed lost, until we were graced with the presence of one older and wiser than Lady Virtuo herself. Star-Rise Drake Rihelma, Smith of the Skies, the Cosmic Oracle. She foresaw our anguish, and in our darkest moment descended upon our crumbling Bastion to grant us new purpose. We are Virmari no more. We are Star-Kin. We are the coven of the Star-Rise Drake. Blessed be her heavenly grace!
