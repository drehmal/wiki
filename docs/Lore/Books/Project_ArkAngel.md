This book can be found in an item frame in the Divination Facility at the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. It describes the creation of Project ArkAngel, which resulted in the creation of the facility that we find this book in, with the ultimate goal of creating a portal to [[Lo'Dahr]].

> -------------------
> Four years ago we discovered an anomalous object in an impact crater near Sal'Tehrmis. It exhibited numerous anomalous properties, such as: Levitation, indestructibility, magnetic poles on a reversal interval, and an astonishingly high energy reading. Potentia within this object rivals that of a Rehntite catalyst's, though we cannot determine the composition. It's unlike anything we've ever seen. After some light experimentation, we noticed that when exposed to different types and strength of magic, the blue vein-like structures running down the surface of the anomaly glowed at different colors and intensities. When exposed to a captured sample of divine magic, energy readings spiked and the veins glowed the brightest we'd ever seen them. This discovery led us into Project ArkAngel.

> Hypothesis: Focus scans show the anomaly is composed of different layers of material, with the innermost core being the source of the high energy readings. If we can break through the surface and expose this core, we may have access to a catalyst with higher potentia than Rehntite by a significant albeit unknown quantity. Uses for even a single catalyst like this are numerous, and could advance Avsohm's technology much further.
>
> Method: Construct a facility in an area of high ambient divine magic, where the anomaly reacts the strongest. Within this facility, we construct the ArkAngel energy array to feed primal energy into the anomaly. By hitting the anomaly with a bombardment of focused primal energy, we can attempt to safely remove the outer layers of material from it and reach the inner core without damaging it. In fact, we could even harness some of the anomaly's own inner power via an energy cascade, should the primal energy beams penetrate deep enough. An energy cascade would allow the anomaly to break itself open from the inside out, rather than us attempting to do so from the outside in, much like how we constructed the Divination Facility. It will take some trial and error to tune the energy levels just right to achieve a cascade, but it should be doable. The beauty of the ArkAngel array is that while firing energy at the anomaly, it will simultaneously run a deep spectral analysis so that we can better understand it. Where did it come from? What's it really made of? How much energy do we need to open it? Soon these questions will be answered, and soon we will have ushered in a new era of Avsohmic technology.
