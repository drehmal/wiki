# Runic Catalysts

![[runic_catalyst.png]]{ width="450" }

**Runic Catalysts** are uncommon loot items found in Drehmal, scattered throughout the world. They are used to purchase [[Runic Blacksmith#Runic Amplifiers|Runic Amplifiers]] and Runic Vessels (Shulker Boxes) from [[Runic Blacksmith|Runic Blacksmiths]] and [[Adventuring Merchant|Adventuring Merchants]], respectively, as well as some other minor applications.

There are hundreds of Runic Catalysts found in Drehmal, often as the final reward for exploring a minor point of interest. After the 75% completion event, they can be purchased, but until a specific area is unlocked, catalysts must be found in the open world.

Runic Catalysts all share the same lore text:

> A small, magical orb valued by traders and arcanists. They have several applications in both magical creations and technology.

## Lore

Lore-wise, runic catalysts are not necessarily all the same thing, despite sharing a common texture and description in-game. Due to the way that Drehmal's magic system functions, almost anything could technically be a "runic catalyst," so long as it is capable of having magical runes transcribed onto it in some way. Runic Catalysts effectively serve as a generic stand-in for any kind of magically charged item, and are therefore placed in many, many different types of structures and environments.

## Full List

The following is a full list of all 376 known Runic Catalyst locations in Drehmal: Apotheosis.
