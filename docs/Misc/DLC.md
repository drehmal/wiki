# uDLC

!!! warning "This page is about an unofficial expansion, not canon content."

Drehmal does not, at this time, have any official expansions made by the entire developer team, or even by multiple dev team members.

<br> <br> <br>

However, there is an unofficial, fan-made modded expansion which is colloquially known as the **"DLC"** or **"uDLC"**. This modded version of the world, created by developer tworoundcats (before being promoted to the dev team), can be found at [this page on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/drehmal-apotheosis-2.2-dlc).

The uDLC is NOT an official expansion, but is still well-known within the Drehmal community. It is **NOT recommended for first-time players** due to the non-canon lore it adds and its generally less serious tone, but it can be an enjoyable way to give the map replay value for players looking to return to the world of Drehmal.

## Content

The DLC adds several new modded gameplay mechanics, including the Better Combat mod, a new enchanting system, trinket and ring slots, new modded currencies, backpacks, and tougher versions of open-field vanilla enemies. The DLC also adds new Mythical and Legendary gear in accordance with Drehmal's conventions, as well as a new, separate system for upgrading mythical weapons. Some villagers also serve as proper NPCs, giving the player explicit quests through dialogue, and existing weapons can be upgraded with new unique abilities.

The expansion's 3.0 update, slated for release in early September 2025, was worked on by multiple other developers, including the lead writer on this wiki. The 3.0 update is a full-scale overhaul of the expansion, including but not limited to a full rewrite of all player-facing text for better lore coherence, a new original dungeon, several brand new encounters and items, and new bosses. No wiki is planned for the expansion, but a general guide document will be posted here once the update is made public.
