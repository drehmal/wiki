# Arcanism 

**Arcanism** is a form of runic magic in Drehmal that involves the carving of magical runes directly onto the wielder, in the form of runic tattoos, scars, bone or antler carvings, and more. 

Its wielders, known as **Arcanists**, are considered to be less learned than [alchemists](Alchemy.md), but can still be extremely powerful on the field of battle. 

## Principles

Like all magic capable of being harnessed by mortals in Drehmal, arcanism relies on magical runes, created by Mystic Elder [[Khive]], in order to procure certain effects. Usually, these would be carved or painted onto other materials as catalysts, especially high-[[potentia]] minerals such as [[rehntite]]. Arcanism instead uses the body as a catalyst, siphoning power directly from the body of the arcanist itself. This is very commonly achieved through the use of runic tattoos and horn/antler carvings, which most serious arcanists are covered in. In more dire situations, arcanists can carve symbols into their own flesh to achieve their desired effects.

In this sense, arcanism can be a very accessible form of magic, as one only needs to learn the proper runes and draw them onto themselves or a material in order to be considered an arcanist. 

Arcanists are capable of a very wide variety of abilities, which sometimes extend into other sub-disciplines of magic. Examples referenced in the map include the ability to summon fireballs, the ability to freeze an enemy's blood, inflicting enemies with festering wounds, electrifying enemies, and more.

While this is a rare event, it is possible for arcanists to overexert themselves, drawing too much potentia from their body, and erupting in a burst of chromatic fury. The [[Forbidden Bones]] book establishes this fact, and also asserts that when arcanists draw power from their body, it physically deforms their bones, filling them with a sickly power that can be weaponized by others.

## Perception

Arcanists are generally feared and respected by the general populace, but most [[Alchemy|alchemists]] look down upon arcanists. Alchemy, a more spiritual practice, is seen as more difficult and a nobler pursuit by those who practice it, and they often view arcanists as lazy and not as dedicated. In particular, calling an alchemist an arcanist is seen as extremely offensive. 

Despite this fact, many still turn to arcanism for its simplicity, and an arcanist absolutely can defeat an average alchemist in combat.

## History in Drehmal

Arcanists have likely existed since the advent of runic magic, dating back to the First Avihm, and they have been a significant part of almost all known armed conflicts in the realm's history. Arcanists have been involved in many wars, with certain specialized arcanists often acting as elite soldiers for different political entities.

Arcanists made up significant parts of the armies of West [[Merijool]], the [[Second Tharhan Empire]] (likely the Nightwalkers, their special enforcing group), and the [[Tehrmari|La'Tehrmari]], to name a few. 

Some specific well-known arcanists include [[Orix Cehein]] (a prominent [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] arcanist who fought in the [[Divine Schism]] and advised Emperor [[Anyr]]), the [[Virmari]] arcanist of the [[Hunting Party]], and Master Arcanist Ohmswil in [[Tharxax City]].
