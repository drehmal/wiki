# Drehua Temple

![[drehua.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Drehua Temple** is a temple complex located in [[Palisades Heath]], atop a hill in the region's central piece of land. This temple is the location of the [[Devotion]] site for the deity [[Drehmal]], and is home to an order of monks who continue to uphold their teachings thousands of years since their last activity.

Drehua Temple can be accessed by simply following the road south from [[Av'Sal]], just on the other side of the bridge after the Palisades Heath [[Terminus Network#Towers|Tower]]. As the main road begins to fade away, a stone path forks off to the right, leading up to the entrance of Drehua Temple.

## Layout/Points of Interest

Drehua Temple has a relatively linear layout, with a single winding path made of diorite in the ground, symbolically representing Drehmal themselves. At the beginning of this path, an infused amethyst block with the [[Welcome to Drehua Temple]] book is found, which provides a hint toward the accepted devotion offerings for Drehmal. The path winds through the gardens at the front of the temple, leading up to the shrine and then through to the monks' living quarters, which contain the Parables.

### Drehmal Shrine

![[drehmal_shrine.png]]

A large courtyard at the southern end of the temple is home to Drehmal's [[devotion]] site, with their altar being found in the large building directly in front of a statue of the deity. Items scattered about the room act as hints for the god's liked devotion items, including oak saplings, beds, and sweet berries, but higher level offerings must be discovered at statues of Drehmal throughout the region.

A mural on the left (eastern) wall of this room depicts Drehmal slumbering beneath the [[Primal Caverns]], as they have been for millennia. A mural on the right (western) wall seems to depict Drehmal against the backdrop of the [[Torahn]], possibly depicting either their birth in the [[Felling]], their reconstruction of the continent, or a prophecy in which they awake.

The small building on the eastern side of this courtyard appears to hold an artistic representation of the world in the First Avihm. This is shown with an oak sapling representing the [[Primal Tree]] in the center, and two continents on either side with their own flowers.

Like all other devotion sites, a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] is found at Drehua Temple. This location's relic vessel is found just outside this courtyard, beneath the center of four stone pillars next to the western side tower.

### Monk Quarters

The path continues upwards through this courtyard to another building, home to the living quarters of the villagers that inhabit the temple. Early-game loot such as bread, scales, and leather armor can be found throughout this structure, but one room in particular is special.

### The Parables

![[parable_room.png]]

The northernmost room in this building is home to a secondary shrine and another statue of Drehmal, as well as four long lore books (11-19 pages in length). These books are the **Parables**—as denoted by signs above them—teachings of Drehua monks that have been written down and preserved for thousands of years.

[[Ehrudei's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Lakebed**, is the first on the left, and recounts Drehmal teaching a Drehmari to take pride in their work, but to also pursue fulfillment through creative ventures.

[[Heixueh's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Riverside Crag**, is the second on the left, and recalls the time that Drehmal convinced its author not to rob a Virmari traveler, and convinced them to lead a pious life of devotion at Drehua instead of a life of crime.

[[Shorusharoh's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Orchard**, is the first on the right, and contains what is likely the last recorded sighting of Drehmal before they went to hibernate beneath the Primal Caverns.

[[Shirua's Teachings]], or the **Parable of the Stone Tablet**, is the second on the right, and contains a writing from the Drehua prophet Shirua, in which Drehmal convinced Shirua to teach the Drehua to write. This decision would ultimately lead to Drehua Temple becoming the leading source on the history of the early Second Avihm in the modern world.

A fifth Parable can also be found, hidden in Drehua Temple, which contains a massive lore revelation.

??? warning "Parable 5"
    Beneath the central green carpet in the Parables Room, a chiseled stone brick is found. Digging through this will reveal a ladder down to a secret room, containing the fifth parable upon a lectern: [[The Parable of the Worm]]. This book contains an origin story for [[Drehmal]] themselves, beginning as only a humble earthworm in the First Avihm, who was ascended to their current level of godhood by being curled in the roots of the [[Primal Tree]] at the time of the [[Felling]].

## Custom Villagers

There are no custom merchants or other villagers living at Drehua Temple, but there are vanilla villagers who can be given workstations.

## Extras

A hidden easter egg room in Drehua Temple can be found along the lower garden wall. Just after the first of five small ponds, press the button on the wall which is directly above a cornflower and an azure bluet. A 2x1 door will quickly open and close, revealing the room. This room is home to a llama named "Dalai Llama," a joke referencing the [Dalai Lama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama).
