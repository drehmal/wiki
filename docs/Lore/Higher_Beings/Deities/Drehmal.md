Drehmal is the most powerful of the three deities born from the Primal Tree upon [[Felling|its collapse]] at the end of the First Avihm. With most of the land destroyed, Drehmal took it upon themselves to shape a new world from the ruined remains of the old one, earning the "Realmbinder" epithet. The deity's name traces its roots to the [[Ancient Drehua|ancient Drehua]] people, who used their word "Drehmal", meaning the world, to refer to the Serpent.

While Drehmal is effectively a direct creation of the Primal Tree like their siblings, they are special in the fact that they inherited easily the largest amount of the Tree's power and memories. In some ways, Drehmal is more of a direct continuation of the Tree's consciousness than they are a child of the Tree.

## Description

![[drehmal_ref.png]]
> Drehmal's official 2.2 reference sheet.

Drehmal takes the form of a gargantuan (referred to as "miles long"), pale green serpent with wooden antlers, a leafy beard, yellow eyes, and sharp teeth. They are known for their incredibly wise and peaceful demeanor, particularly as passed down through [[Ancient Drehua]] stories. Drehmal is referred to exclusively with gender-neutral "they," "them," and "their" pronouns.

## History 

In the First Avihm, before being granted their current deific identity, Drehmal was merely a simple worm. As recounted by [[The Parable of the Worm]], they were approached by two figures, a "beast of the sky" and a "beast of the depths". Both criticized the worm for not acting on their potential, yet they resolved to wait for the right time.

During the [[Felling]], the worm nestled between the roots of the Primal Tree, and the Tree gifted a portion of its remaining essence to the worm, ascending them to the divine serpent Drehmal.

Drehmal spent the early days of the Second Avihm molding landforms and fostering new life. During this time, Drehmal often interacted with [[Drehmari]], especially the ancient Drehua people of Palisahd (modern day [[Palisades Heath]]). Four such interactions, as recorded by Drehua monks who became heralded as prophets, are recorded in the four Parables at Drehua Temple. After Drehmal's work was completed, they buried themselves far beneath the [[Primal Caverns]] and fell into a deep, dream-filled slumber. 

Drehmal continued to be worshipped throughout Palisades Heath, the Central Plains ([[Capital Valley]] + [[Gulf of Drehmal]]) and the Heartwood. Worship of Drehmal became most widespread under the rule of [[Avsohm]], which originated in the Central Plains and spread its religion around the continent. Worship of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) was banned in the empire under the reign of [[Ifeihl|Zorhis Ifeihl]], and [[Maelihs]] was an enemy of the state, meaning citizens paid homage to either [[Virtuo]] or Drehmal. 

Today, Drehmal is still worshiped in their traditional sphere of influence from before the rise and expansion of Avsohm. However, it has been nearly 3000 years since they were last seen above the surface, and their faith has not been the dominant religious force on the continent for a long time.

## Devotion Guide

Drehmal's [[devotion]] site is [[Drehua Temple]], a temple complex in [[Palisades Heath]].

![[drehmal_shrine.png]]

A large courtyard at the southern end of the temple is home to Drehmal's altar, found in the large building directly in front of a statue of the deity. Items scattered about the room act as hints for the god's liked devotion items, including oak saplings, beds, and sweet berries, but higher level offerings must be discovered at statues of Drehmal throughout the region.

## Late-Game Info

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "LD_spoiler.md"

While Drehmal remains in their deep slumber for the entirety of the player's experience in the current day, there is one point at which the serpent can be somewhat directly interacted with, at the Tower of Drehmal in [[Ytaj]]. Here, the player seemingly lives through the dreams and thoughts of Drehmal themselves, while gradually ascending the tower to reach a second devotion shrine to Drehmal at its peak. 

A transcript of the climb's dialogue can be found [[Dreams_of_the_Serpent.md|here]].

Drehmal is also prominently featured in the [[True End|final sequence of the game]], told to the player by [[yellow|???]].
