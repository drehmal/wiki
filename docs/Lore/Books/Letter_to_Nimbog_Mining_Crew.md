This book can be found in an abandoned mineshaft between [[Nimahj Swamp]] and South Tharxax tower.

> Dear Nimbog Mining Crew,
>
> I hope the operation is going smoothly. I know that the swamps can be treacherous this time of year. Cautionary measures against flooding are absolutely necessary here, especially during Dahrohma.
>
> Remember, the ore deposit you are looking for should be exactly 18 meters below sea level. We need it extracted before Maelmaklah. The processors here at Tharxax are growing impatient.
>
> Sincerely,
>
> Hosim Arghelin
