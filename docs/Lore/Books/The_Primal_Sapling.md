## Location/Summary
This book can be found on a lectern in [[Okeke]], atop a lighthouse at the docks. It references a "great tree" to the east of the town, pointing the player towards the [[Primal Sapling]].

## Transcription
> Do you see it, in the distance? The leafy branches of a great tree? The fog may obscure your vision, but it does not obscure mine. I see beyond the mountains to the east a primal remnant of what came before. Alas, its malignant will lies in opposition to its predecessor. A cancerous growth upon the realm, indeed, despite the inherent futility. No one can escape the coming storm.
