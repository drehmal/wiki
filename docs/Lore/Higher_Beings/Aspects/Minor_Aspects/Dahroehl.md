## Description

![[dahroehl_ref.png]]
> Dahroehl's official reference image.

Dahroehl is a long, serpentine blue and gold dragon, similar in appearance to an eel. A trail of blue flame follows behind the Aspect's tail.

Dahroehl's passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] reads:

> Fluvial Dahroehl, Aspect of Freshwater
> ***
> Child of Dahr, they populated the world with rivers and lakes.

Dahroehl is unique among the Aspects in that third-person references to Dahroehl alternate between masculine (he/him) and feminine (she/her) pronouns, as seen in [[Three Great Sigils]]. This seems to indicate that Dahroehl is genderfluid to some degree, matching well with his domain. For the sake of simplicity, the map often uses they/them pronouns for Dahroehl, and it seems that the alternating he/she usage may be exclusive to Dahroehl's worshippers in-universe.

Personality-wise, Dahroehl is consistently referred to as somewhat vain.

### Color/Build Scheme

Dahroehl's color scheme appears to be blue and green. Blocks commonly associated with the Aspect of Freshwater include prismarine and its variants, as well as any flowing water.

## In-Map References

Dahroehl is most prominently mentioned in two locations: the village of [[Hevhlak]] and the [[Temple of Dahroehl]] in [[Anyr'Nogur]].

The Temple is located in northwestern Anyr'Nogur, built by the Aspect's worshippers into the side of a canyon. It contains hidden offerings for him, which are presented to the player as loot hidden behind puzzles from the [[Cryptic Ode]] book. This is also the site of the only Dahroehl-centered [[Artifacts|artifact]], a golden sword called [[Artifacts#Mirage|Mirage]]. Its lore text reads:

> Like the brooding and vain Water Wyrm themselves, Dahroehl's blessings are often double-edged.

It seems to be the case that Dahroehl was worshipped in Anyr'Nogur due to the scarcity of freshwater in the region, making its presence something to be celebrated and asked for.

In Hevhlak, the book [[Three Great Sigils]] establishes that Dahroehl is worshipped by at least some of the [[Tehrmari]] residents of this town. It states that Dahroehl himself visited the town three times and spoke to its inhabitants, tasking them with building three sigils out of flowing freshwater canals. These canals do not appear to actually exist in game.

## Late-Game Info

Dahroehl's room in [[Ytaj]] seems to be the tower in the southern portion of her father's area. He is mentioned by Maelihs as one of the few Aspects who still makes frequent visits to Ytaj in person, but cannot be found or interacted with in-game.
