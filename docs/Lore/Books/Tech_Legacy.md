## Transcription
> I've not long for this world, but I can rest assured that the proud Daar's Gap Light will forever keep the ships off that blasted Faehrcylian shore.
>
> Although I am but a simple lighthouse keeper, I have conquered the scientific mysteries of the world (with the help of my nephew, Hugh, of course).
>
> To any travelers who may inquire upon me or the discoveries I have made, I simply ask that you leave an old man's life's work lie. Do not take my tower apart!
