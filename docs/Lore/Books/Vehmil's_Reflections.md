This book can be found in a chest in the [[Ring Facility]]. Written by [[Baen Vehmil]], it reflects on his life to date, with emphasis on the positive impacts his work and friends—especially [[Gohri Zed]] and [[Thresa Vera]]—have had on his life. He also expresses his disdain for [[Anyr]] and other aspects of the Avsohmic government that he finds disturbing, such as [[Red Dawn]].

## Transcription
> I was resistant, at first, to outright join the DoS. It was a lot of fun to go all over the world, learning about ancient runes. My travels took me everywhere- from the forbidden land of Sahd, to the spectacular city of Athrah in Casai, to ancient cliff dwellings in Grand Pike Canyon.
>
> But one thing was always constant- I was alone.
>
> I like to work alone. When I get a lead for newly discovered runes that I think would have some application in one of my projects, I love the freedom of being able to just go. And when I’m in the lab, I love having complete control over my process. If I mess up, it’s my fault. Things are simple.
>
> And yet, I’m far happier today working with thousands of colleagues than I was back in my loner days. I attribute that to a couple of factors.
>
> For one, I have the opportunity to do far more interesting things. We got to visit the MOONS! And I have contributed to projects on a scale I never would have thought possible.
>
> But the biggest reason for my happiness is the presence of my friends. Gohri has my back, and is always willing to work with me on a concept, no matter how far-fetched. And Thresa has completely changed everything. It feels like I only need to describe some problem to them, and she has the answer. With her keeping the broader picture in mind, I am comfortable sitting down and obsessing about one of my projects. I know that she respects my skills, and I do my best to reward that faith. She is an incredible boss. Both Gohri and Thresa are so sweet and funny, and I absolutely adore them both.
>
> On the other hand, I don’t like Emperor Anyr at all. I hate that his priority is always to conquer and exploit the conquered. I hate that he kidnaps talented children like that Ottis boy and puts them to work in his facilities. I hate all of the things I’ve heard about Red Dawn. It sometimes disturbs me that I am furthering his agenda in some way. But then I tell myself that Thresa will never guide this department towards anything but the betterment of all Drehmari through technology.
>
> It isn’t without its stressors, but my life is relatively good right now. Perhaps I will go to investigate the floating ruins in Rihelma’s domain next week. The former inhabitants were apparently quite gifted at runecarving.
