**Orchidaceae** (pronounced or-kid-ay-see) is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The flower-shaped legendary sword Orchidaceae is a treasure hunter's (or a grindy Minecraft player's) best friend, coming with a high Looting enchantment and a special ability that increases the amount of XP dropped by mobs it kills. It is found in [[Akhlo'Rohma]].

| **Lore**                      | Alchemy as modern practitioners know it was born in the lavish halls of the original Ancehl Castle. Although initially bound by a strict code of ethics, disagreements about those limits led to infighting and societal collapse. From the ashes, a new order arose which renounced all moral boundaries. |
| **Obtain**                    | In the crypts beneath [[Ancehl Castle]] in northwest [[Akhlo'Rohma]].   |

## Gameplay
Orchidaceae is an NBT-modified diamond sword, and inherits the base durability of a diamond sword.

The weapon is relatively mediocre in terms of its base stats, but its strength lies in its Looting enchantment and special ability. Together, these effects make Orchidaceae extract the highest amount of loot and experience points from mobs of any weapon in the game, making it optimal if you decide to build a mob farm in Drehmal.

Orchidaceae's special ability is passive, and applies to all mobs that the player kills which have an item drop or who drop XP. It gives a flat increase to XP drops.

## How to Obtain
Orchidaceae is located in the crypts beneath [[Ancehl Castle]], in northwestern [[Akhlo'Rohma]].

Once inside the castle's walls, the crypts can be accessed via a long spiral staircase along the southern edge of the estate. This legendary weapon can be found at the end of the path through the iron bars near the bottom of this staircase, in a tomb guarded by a witch and two baby zombie spawners.

## Lore
The description of the item itself references the early practices of [[Alchemy]], developed here at Ancehl Castle. It is not clear exactly how this weapon factors into the history of alchemy.

## Extras
The word "Orchidaceae" is the scientific name for the Orchid family, a common type of flower.
