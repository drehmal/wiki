 

This book can be found in a chest at the [[Burnt Palace]]. It documents the mental state of [[Maelihs]] during his war against [[Insohm]], as he orders his army not to deploy the Skullmother and ends up personally setting her free rather than using her as a weapon again.

> Insohm's use of Avsohmic technology has us somewhat worried, but we believe that usage of the Mother will be able to repel them and render their lands uninhabitable. We now have her nested at the Birthing Grounds to prepare a small legion of Skullbeasts.

> Mael has told us to bide our time before deploying the Mother. We reluctantly obliged, but reminded him that the war would be over much sooner if we sent her out now. He simply ignored us and returned to his quarters. All operations concerning the Mother have ceased, for now.

> Mael has been spending more and more time away from the Palace, leaving the Generals in charge of most operations. After the loss at Caer Adacia, Insohm poses a real threat to our domain. The Generals are against deploying the Mother out of fear of Mael's wrath. I've been quietly urging them to do so. Insohm could end us forever.

> Av3 687, 4th of Tahsganrohma

> Mael returned to us with grave news - he personally set the Mother free, removing her shackles and setting her out to sea. Ethgar, rightfully so, claimed that he was being reckless and emotional. Mael threatened to set him out alongside the Mother without a boat. The topic has died down since. Rhalon believes she may be able to find the Mother and bring her back, but is afraid of Mael's mental instability. With that, the war is lost. We can only defend a siege in Tharxax for so long.

> Av3 700, 2nd of Ohmamari

> It's over. Mael and Virtuo reached an ultimatum and ended the conflict with Insohm. I truly fear what this means for us. Mael has gone insane, giving up so much of his domain so easily. I hope he has a change of heart.
