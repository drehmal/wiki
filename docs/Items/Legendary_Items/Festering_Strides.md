## Gameplay
Festering Strides has the ability to significantly alter a build, as it adds 10 max health while simultaneously making all worn armor 40% less effective and 40% weaker. In turn, it grants the player the Absorption II effect, which gives the player an extra 4 hearts (8 health) roughly once every 24 seconds.

This means that Festering Strides can be well utilized in a build prioritizing very high health, such as heavy tank builds, although it does neutralize some of the armor that would also contribute to such a build.

## How to Obtain
Festering Strides is dropped by the Shatterhorn Warden at [[Shatterhorn Gulch]] in [[Grand Pike Canyon]], upon being killed by a player for the first time. The warden is immortal, and will respawn a few seconds after being killed, but does not have any additional drops after the legendary has been found.

## Lore
The boots were originally worn by the entity that you take them from—the warden of Shatterhorn Gulch, a long-standing prison in eastern Grand Pike Canyon. The item's lore text states that he was cursed with immortality and endless festering wounds, explaining why he cannot be permanently killed, as well as tying in to the boots' effects; the health boost and absorption make the player much harder to kill, but the festering wounds are the source of the green particles emitted by the boots and the armor penalties.
