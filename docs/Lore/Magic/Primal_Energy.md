**Primal Energy** is an essential element of reality and the fundamental driving force of the universe. 

[[Khive|Khive's]] ability to manipulate and compile primal energy allowed for the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) to carry out their tasks in creating the world. In the Second Avihm, the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm's]] meddling in the collection and utilization of the energy in its raw form is what lent them their unchallenged power and technological superiority.

## Description

Based on the community restoration of the [[Codex Celestus]], it appears that primal energy is one of two fundamental substances in the overall universe of Drehmal, alongside souls. Primal Energy is described in its raw form as chaotic, but its applications are functionally infinite. It can be used as a standard power source similar to electricity, it can be utilized by [gods](/Lore/Higher_Beings/) in line with their specific powers, or it can be weaponized through advanced technology.

Most depictions of primal energy are yellow. It may appear in-game as blasts of laser beam-like energy, pools of liquid, or yellow stained glass, among others. 

## Locations and Use

The [[Nothing]] is filled with pockets of Primal Energy, which are extremely harmful to living beings in raw form. The tear at [[Mt. Yavhlix]] exposed the realm to this external primal energy, which began to seep into the realm. Supposedly, allowing this energy to leak into the realm unabated would eventually destroy Drehmal, and it was temporarily sealed.

[[Avsohm]] sought control of Mt. Yavhlix due to the opportunity this tear presented, and claimed it around Av2 1646. The Empire began to siphon the primal energy that leaked out of what they came to call the "Spiral Anomaly", constructing massive pipes to carry the energy throughout the continent. These pipes powered the entire empire, and eventually, the advent of the [[Terminus Network]] allowed for wireless transportation of this energy. 

Avsohm also heavily weaponized primal energy, most notably fitting it into blasters, including the [[Zenith]] mythical weapon.

Based on the Codex, the largest stable source of Primal Energy in the realm is the personal stockpile of Mystic Elder [[Khive]], located somewhere on [[LD|Lo'Dahr]].
