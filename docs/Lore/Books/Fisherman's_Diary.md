This book can be found in a chest in the ruins on the south side of the lake which holds the [[Ring Facility]]. It explores some of the effects that Avsohm's presence on [[Lo'Dahr]] had on the natives of the moon, in this instance making fishing in the lake harder.

## Transcription
> Those Avsohmic pricks think they can set up in our lake and get away with it? They've already started scaring away the eels with the sound of construction. A few of the elders went to speak with Avsohmic soldiers but they were given the cold shoulder. Another group was sent to speak with the La'Tehrmari mystics deeper in Khive's Domain. They should be able to commune with the Elder Aspect and kick Avsohm out for good. There's no chance the Mystic Khive would just let them stick around.
