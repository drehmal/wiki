This holotext can be found at the Resonant Eye, deep within the [[Resonant Halls]]. It confirms that the entity discovered in the second dive is [[Tethlaen]], and its author, C.S.O. Eleis, resolves to lead the mission to enter the Nothing and meet with the Aspect herself.

> After the first dive, Orix had all non-essential personnel evacuated from the entire facility until we could discern the nature of the entity. With the second dive, he managed to establish a dialogue. Tethlaen, the Ever-Fear, alive and residing within the Nothing after all this time. An expedition into the anomaly has been approved. Communicating with Tethlaen through the Eye is only so effective, we need to be there ourselves. I’ve volunteered to aid in leading the charge. Virtuo bless me so that I may return safe. Hail to Avsohm.
