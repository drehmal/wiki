> My name is Captain Ihb, the most daring pirate to ever live! On my latest journey, I sailed north from Casai, in search of the fabled twin isles of sunlight. They say that long ago, a group of barbarians were exiled from Casai, shackled to rafts, and set adrift into the sea. Many thought them dead, but rumors say they survived, and established a grand civilization on one of the isles. It pains me to report I saw no remnants of such civilization while exploring, despite my thorough search! Perhaps they did perish, or perhaps they are craftier than anyone thought.
