> Activity Log- Project Panopticon

> CONFIDENTIAL BY ORDER OF EMPEROR ANYR
>
> Officer: Chief Observer Orix Cehein
>
> Background: When excavation of the Spiral Anomaly began in an attempt to accelerate Primal Energy collection, workers began detecting an unusually high level of resistance pushing back against the mining equipment. Facing uncertain consequences, Chief Science Officer Eleis made the decision to employ the cutting-edge Resonant Eye. To pilot it as Chief Observer, trusted operative Orix Cehein was hand-selected by the Emperor on account of his many years of faithful service to Avsohm.
>
> The following actions and observations were taken and made by the Chief Observer in furtherance of the Empire's goals. Hail to Avsohm.
>
> 1. Assisted in setting up Resonant Eye. Enough power is stored in the reserves to make three Dives.
>
> 2. Tested out the equipment and ensured that all is in order. Ready to proceed.
> Informed the Emperor of the occasion. He emphasized the importance of timeliness in these operations and encouraged us to “do what you need to, but find a way to expand energy production, or you will be replaced by someone who will”.
>
> 3. Performed Dive One. Facility evacuated until further notice aside from essential workers and myself. What appeared to be a living, moving lifeform was detected beyond the Spiral Anomaly. Conditions seem relatively stable; a broad stone shelf was detected. Dive was prematurely aborted for reconsideration due to the presence of the unforeseen foreign lifeform.
>
> 4. Sought and obtained permission from the Chief Science Officer to perform a second Dive for the purpose of contacting the lifeform. We need to know what we're getting ourselves into.
>
> 5. Performed Dive Two. Made contact with the lifeform, claiming to be Tethlaen, Aspect of Fear. Rihselch speech was detected. Subject spoke unclearly, did not identify their location. Full report of the interaction was obtained and sent to the Emperor, Eleis, and the other leadership.
>
> 6. Prepared facilities at Yavhlix for Blue Exodus troops, linguists, alchemists, and other researchers in preparation to continue excavation of the Spiral Anomaly.
>
> 7. Performed Dive Three to remotely monitor the mission into the Anomaly. Conflict initiated between the subject and Exodus troops. Forty-one casualties sustained. Reports of mental breakdowns from other essential workers within the mountain are widespread. If not for my training, I would have succumbed to panic, but I managed to continue the mission. Chief Science Officer Eleis sustained severe injuries and is paralyzed from the neck down. Nonetheless, after she was stabilized, I received orders not to abort the mission. I note my objection to this order but continue to fulfill my station.
>
> 8. Progress is being made in negotiations with Tethlaen. After securing an agreement, the Aspect will:
> - Keep the Breach (Spiral Anomaly) largely sealed but permit the Empire to collect and pipe a limited amount of energy into Drehmal for our own purposes
> - Allow Avsohmic builders to construct collection facilities on Tethlaen’s rock in the Nothing
> - In exchange, the Avsohmic negotiators offered to construct advanced restorative devices made with primal catalyst technologies to combat the toll that the Nothing takes on Tethlaen’s body and mind.
>
> Then, I witnessed the Avsohmic delegation leave through the Breach. I would be remiss if I were to neglect to mention that thirty-seven loyal Avsohmic citizens perished from insanity and other anomalies detected in and around Mt. Yavhlix.
>
> Nine months since my last log, the Breach has been patched, and energy flows freely in quantities never before witnessed. Chief Science Officer Thresa has given orders for me to use the Resonant Eye as I see fit. I have three goals.
>
> A. Maintain communications with Tethlaen and establish a warning system in case their health is threatened or an anomaly from the Nothing could cause harm to Avsohm’s interests.
>
> B. Identify the source of interference that intercepted communications with Tethlaen in Dive Two and distorted the message delivered to the Retina.
>
> C. Learn more about what lies in the Nothing and determine what threats and opportunities lie within.
>
> 10.   Began a dive to speak with Tethlaen. We discussed Avsohm’s activities and goals. They spoke of their desire to save the realm but worried that unless something changed, the Breach would...
