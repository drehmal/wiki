# Lahrs

**Lahrs** is the Aspect of Resonance. Encompassing a slightly more vague domain than the other Aspects, Lahrs seems to govern a fundamental force that drives the cyclical nature of the world, and is associated with things such as music and mushrooms.

## Characteristics

Lahrs' passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] reads as follows:

> Lahrs, the Burgeoning, Aspect of Resonance
> ***
> Considered by many to be a Major Aspect, Lahrs tends to a wide domain encompassing cycles, music, the seasons, balance, growth, and decay. Without their influence, the realm would quickly decay into nothingness.

Lahrs' canon pronouns are given to be he/him or she/her by the developers, but this usually translates to use of they/them to refer to the Aspect in-map. There are no canon instances of Lahrs being referred to using feminine pronouns.

Lahrs' physical form is not depicted or described anywhere in the map, officially.

He is portrayed as very diplomatic, often embodying the spirit of compromise.

## Role

Lahrs' domain is **resonance**, a concept that is defined very loosely within the Drehmal universe. One book attempts to describe it as such:

> Resonance is perfect harmony, like the concentric ripples from a pebble dropped in placid water.
>
> Resonance is the force which ensures that the birds come to roost every spring and pushes the mushrooms up from a forest floor.
>
> Resonance is the compromise that keeps Loe and Lai from destroying the climate in their feud, and keeps Maen’s pain from eclipsing fear or pleasure.
>
> Resonance is more complicated than any Avsohmic device and yet just as simple as an eternally spinning wheel.
>
> Resonance is the sound of the universe playing in concert.

Therefore, it seems that resonance is very closely tied to the concept of balance and cycles, ensuring that the world moves forward naturally and that no one force envelops another.

This extends to many of the dichotomies highlighted in the world of Drehmal, such as those between opposing Aspects: [[Lai]] and [[Loe]]'s feud of warmth and cold are kept in check by Lahrs, as well as the balances between the Primal Emotions.

Due to the apparent importance of Lahrs' domain, some people consider them to be a Major Aspect. The argument against this idea is not clearly laid out, but of note, the major Aspect/Deity family tree mural shows Lahrs as being part of a separate branch from the rest of the Aspects, alongside [[Verrhys]].

Verrhys' domain is similarly abstract, being the Aspect of Silence, seemingly depicting silence and resonance as opposing forces. This mural does not directly show Lahrs as being created by the [[Primal Tree]] like the rest of the Major Aspects, although it curiously does not show the fences that usually indicate parentage. It seems likely from this mural that Verrhys and Lahrs are related somehow, and are not of the same lineage as the other Aspects, but their relationship is not well-defined.

## In-Map References

Lahrs is not explicitly mentioned in many sources besides those already mentioned, but does seem to have visible influence in a few areas.

Enemies named "Lahrs Adherents" can be found in small groups throughout [[Akhlo'Rohma]], including zombies that guard the region's Terminus tower and skeletons found in very small outposts throughout the area. Their specific origins and lore relevance are not clear, but this does seem to show that Lahrs had worshippers in Akhlo'Rohma.

## Late-Game Info

Lahrs is one of 14 Aspects with a domain on [[Lo'Dahr]]. [[Lahrs' Domain|His domain]] is among the smallest on the moon, and is dominated by mushrooms.

> Lahrs' room in Ytaj.

Lahrs also has a room in [[Ytaj]], a large theater in the east. It features a very large drum set, presumably to be played by Lahrs himself, suggesting that the Aspect is quite large.

Lahrs is mentioned prominently in two sections of the community reconstruction of the [[Codex Celestus]]:

> The Aspect of -----, the one I refer to here as our ----- --------, has erased their self from our minds, leaving only silence where memory once thrived. I remember when I was young, ambitious and prideful. Our ----- -------- cared for me and my siblings, and helped us find compromise, though it pained them to see a disc begin to take shape around the roots.
>
> That spirit of compromise lives on in Lahrs. As Aspect of Resonance, they help make sure that our disciplines play in harmony, and that creation remains ordered and cyclical. It is as if each of our  ----- --------’s memories was inherited by Lahrs, leaving only an empty shell behind. Even putting our minds together, all of the siblings of my generation could remember almost nothing about our (fathe/mothe)r.

The first part of this is believed to refer to Verrhys, given its references to silence and the fact that [[Khive]] does not remember the name of the subject. The second paragraph establishes that Lahrs has inherited the spirit of compromise from their mysterious, forgotten predecessor, inheriting their memories. A later section implies that Lahrs has had a significant role in managing the egos of the Aspects, attempting to act as a mediator between them, to varying degrees of success.

Lahrs is also the presumptive subject of the [[The Facets#Facet VI|sixth Facet]], which is heavily themed around the concept of resonance.
