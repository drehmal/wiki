> On top of proud Aldregakar, the mountain we sculptors call home, lies another world. Wind whistles through strange rock formations, and odd animals and plants abound. Loryk, the oldest of our coven, once set foot up there, and even ventured into the legendary Augural Tangle. He had just enough time to grab a few handfuls of clay before Elder Rihelma’s guardians chased him out. The Aspect of Sky does not like to be disturbed within her sanctuary, after all. I cannot say I condone Loryk’s actions, but he did make a very beautiful pot with what he found up there.
