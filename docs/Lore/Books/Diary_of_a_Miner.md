## Transcription
> Why oh why did I come to this horrid place? I had heard stories of strange crystal growths, but upon arrival and testing, these are completely typical ore deposits. Admittedly, the diamond contained within these crystals have made me filthy rich... if I ever get out of here alive! I still need to extract the diamonds, but the fauna in this area are particularly feisty. When I return to Naharja I reckon I will retire, and live the rest of my life in complete luxury. But... in the distance, I see another pillar. One with an even higher quantity of diamonds. Is it worth the trek?
