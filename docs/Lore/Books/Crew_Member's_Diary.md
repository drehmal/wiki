## Transcription
> Never in a million years would I have thought I would be soaring in the skies amongst the black veil. Born on the earthly soil, and to thrive so far above it... it's a dream come true.
>
> I would always look up to the night sky and wonder what was up there. What it was like.
>
> My dreams have come true, and I am forever grateful.
