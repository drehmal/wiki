 

This book can be found in a chest in southern [[Av'Sal]]. It contains a reflection on a debate between four Drehmari (likely children) about religion, in which the author comes to believe that [[Anyr]] may possess a fragment of the spirit of [[Drehmal]] due to his perceived ability to cover great distances nearly instantly (very likely by utilizing the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]]).

## Transcription
> Cehra, Loam, Vehal and I were having one of our Rahlar Debate Clubs when the topic of religion came up, as usual. Loam spoke about the incredible beauty of Virtuo and her commitment to making the realm a safer and more peaceful place for all, arguing that her goals were the same as those of Avsohm.
>
> Cehra offered a snide remark about the real reasons for Loam’s devotion to the Lady of the Mirror, and then predictably began her diatribe against divinity in any form. If Aspects and Deities really created the world and were made to serve Drehmari, then why did they war and kill one another? Why do so many still suffer? Why did Drehmal abandon us?
>
> I felt anger rising in my throat, but before I could respond, Vehal spoke. An unusual event. Most Rahlars, he would only walk with us and listen. His words were metered and precise: “Drehmal did not abandon us. In fact, They still live in the form of the man who rules our state, Anyr.”
>
> Of course, the rest of us had heard this argument before. Normally, the official line is that Anyr carried the same spirit of Drehmal which had lived within Drehn and once guided our empire to prosperity. The main argument against the theory is that there was no evidence for it.
>
> Until now. Apparently, last Tohrlar, Emperor Anyr was spotted in Sal'Anyr giving an address in the early morning and then back here at Av'Sal before lunch. Could anyone not wielding the power of the Serpent really do that? No airship that we know about is capable of making a journey like that. And the reports were each confirmed by many.
>
> Certainly, some other explanation is possible. Body doubles or some sort of teleportation magic could be to blame. But I am starting to wonder if Vehal is right.
