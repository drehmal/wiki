## Transcription
> Working here has been a massive shift from my tenure at **Mt. Yavhlix**, but tomorrow, I relocate to the **Stasis Facility**. Vehmil and Gohri are already there, they’ve been doing a lot of hard work getting the first long-term tests prepared. I’ve been saying my goodbyes to the people here around the office, they might not see me for a couple of years after all! I hope all goes well while I’m gone, and I’m excited to see how the empire has grown once we emerge from initial tests.
