 
This page contains the text of the nine unnamed books at the Timberhearth Observatory and Museum in [[Spearhead Forest]]. This building is a reference to the Museum in Timber Hearth in the game Outer Wilds. Each of the nine books is placed on a lectern and describes a nearby exhibit, typically of Avsohmic-era technology.

## Rehntite Catalyst

This book describes a rehntite catalyst, which fueled one of the many elevator chutes found in Avsohmic ruins.

### Transcription
> This rare, functional rehntite catalyst was very carefully removed and transported from the ruins of Av'Sal! The Avsohmic people were notoriously mistrustful of stairs, so they used these to get up and down places instead.

## Mosaic

This book is placed in front of a piece of gray glazed terracotta, presumably describing some kind of Sasquatch in Drehmal mythology.

### Transcription
> The ultimate goal of any alchemist is the achievement of "The Great Work", commonly defined by many as the usage of Divine Magic by a mortal. These are some common alchemic supplies, but who knows, these could just be the key to completing The Great Work...

## Rhaveloth Rubble

This book is found in front of a pile of blackstone.

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4143  |  127  |  279  |

### Transcription
> A piece of rubble taken from inside Rhaveloth, the city fortress at the heart of the Carmine. The rock itself is obviously volcanic, possibly taken straight from the Carmine's deep layers of stone.

## Heartwood Saplings

This book lies between two saplings: a potted jungle sapling on the left, and a potted dark oak sapling on the right. This establishes that the [[South Heartwood]], pre-Desolation, was more of a jungle biome than a dark forest like the North.

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4140  |  127  |  285  |


### Transcription
> Two saplings, the left one being from the destroyed southern Heartwood, the right being from the present-day northern Heartwood. A tragic event caused the lives of thousands and the death of an entire ecosystem. We are incredibly lucky to have some specimens preserved.

## Early Holotext Prototype

This book is found beside a sandstone wall and a piece of green concrete, which projects a crude version of holotext when stood upon. This is a reference to the writing system of the Nomai in Outer Wilds, as well as the holotexts found throughout Drehmal.

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4143  |  127  |  291  |

### Transcription
> This odd piece of early Avsohmic technology was taken from the ruins of Sal'Anyr. It contains what appears to be an early test of an apparatus used throughout that ancient empire. This is the only known example still functioning.

## Anti-Gravity Pillar

This book is found in front of two quartz pillars over a bottom-slab and below a top-slab, seemingly levitating.

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4133  |  127  |  291  |

### Transcription
> This mysterious pillar somehow defies gravity. Discovered in what is believed to be an ancient Avsohmic facility, the structure it was supporting remained in place after it was removed.

This book is found before a singular quartz block and prismarine brick slab.

### Transcription
> A temple chunk and ceiling tile from the Kiln of Virtuo, the sacred center of worship of the Goddess. Donated by esteemed patron Sniki Slipshear of Firteid.
