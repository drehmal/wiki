## Transcription
> The Heart is UNORDERED. It is the unconscious drive of creation. It is thoughtless, acting through body and body alone. It is an unordered object, one of many but the greatest of them. It cannot be judged as rational or irrational. It simply is.
>
> The Mind is ORDERED. They are the conscious drive of creation. They are careful, plotting, and deliberate. They act with intention and desire. They are an ordered being like us but far greater in all facets. They are the paramount soul.
>
> Yet, the Mind is IRRATIONAL. They see fit to play the song of souls and matter as a solo act. Our chords are seen as malign and disruptive. They mock us and spit on us. To them, we are irrational, the hapless mortals who cry out in defiance of the inevitable. To them, we cannot accept an end.
>
> They are the actor who creates an end, to contribute to a purpose that delays an end. It is the apex of hypocrisy. The Mind is more mortal than they are willing to admit.
>
> What will they do when inevitability comes for them?
