## Transcription
> Whispered in drowned catacombs and dismal backwaters are the secrets of the Skeveraan, an elusive sect of Bionic Alchemists dedicated to a sick art. By scavenging dead bodies from graveyards, wretched Skeveraans are able to stitch together the corpses of the fallen, creating bionic monstrosities stronger than any common zombie. Skev (as they are known) are often composed of multiple creatures stitched together, in order to provide benefits from each.
>
> The art of the Skeveraans is often looked down upon, even amongst the more fanatic Alchemist. Less radical Alchemists see it as wholly immoral and inhumane, while more passionate ones see such trivialities as a betrayal of The Work.
