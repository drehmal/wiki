## Transcription
> Boss says our goal's just over this hill. Can't wait to slough off our travelling gear; it's been ages since we've relaxed. Some cushy Insohmic castle seems like the best place for it. Supposed to have been some "Coven of Potentia", whatever that means. Sounds like a load of mihk.
