## Transcription
> Entry 1:
> I've been lost in this aspect-damned swamp for nearly three days now. I'm almost certain I'm going in circles. All this for some shoddy swamp hermit. Father says she's some kind of pyromantic prodigy, but that must be a load of bollocks. Lailoehn only blesses members of our clan.
>
> Entry 2:
> A royal heir should simply not have to put up with this kind of treatment! Why I did not pay a group of mercenaries to abduct this hermit is beyond me. Not that the locals have been any help. Most refuse to speak to me, and the ones that do refuse to tell me the location of the pyromancer. Dirty moonshiners, one and all. My best lead tells me that she lives in the far west of the swamp, not that that narrows it down much. Why is a pyromancer living in a swamp, anyways? Surely they'd appreciate the comfort of Ytaj or Naharja more than this fetid place.
>
> Entry 3:
> I've been traveling west now for many days. I stopped keeping track a while back. But finally, I've had an amount of good luck. After passing under a great blue bridge, I came across a village of swamp people. I suppose I look sufficiently haggard at this point, as they accepted me in without complaint. They even provided me with food and drink, once I told them the nature of my quest. It pains me to accept pity from these commoners, but they seem decent enough. They even told me the location of the hermit, directly north of here.
>
> Entry 4:
> I believe I may have caught sight of the hermit for the first time. She was clad head to toe in black rags, completely obscuring her body and face. I only saw her from a distance, but she was using flame to roast a wretched Dahrspawn alive! It must be her.
>
> I must admit, the power and precision of her flames exceeded my expectations. I had no clue those outside our clan could summon such powerful fires, but I saw the proof before my very eyes. She will make a proper mentor, I am certain. And maybe... I will finally become more than a disappointment.
>
> Entry 5:
> The hermit turned me away. I was... shocked, to say the least. I could barely believe my ears, at first. Even after I explained who I was, where I came from, she dismissed me! Said that I could not bear the burden of pyromancy. But I cannot return, having learned nothing.
>
> I would never be accepted, as I am now. Powerless, untouched by the gift of flame. I must learn from her. I have no other option.
>
> Entry 6:
> I live amongst the moonshiners, now. I am grateful they took me in, but I must admit I was not prepared for the strenuous work required to live with them! Late to bed and early to rise when you live in such a treacherous area, I suppose. I still visit the hermit everyday, even after she offended me so. The way she speaks suggests wisdom far beyond that of even Grandfather's, loath as I am to admit it. Yet despite my dogged persistence, she refuses to take me as a pupil. However, I believe I am wearing her down. It is only a matter of time, now.
>
> Entry 7:
> The hermit has finally, graciously, taken me in as her pupil. She says that I remind her of herself, when she was young. Was she a royal, too? Beyond that, she has spoken nothing of her past; she has barely spoken at all, but has allowed me to remain in her presence.
>
> Entry 8:
> Lessons are brief and infrequent, but are nonetheless illuminating. Her flame is unlike any I've seen before; not the roaring inferno of Lailoehn, nor the chromatic Sacred Flame of Lai - it is something entirely unique to her, surgical and precise.
>
> It may seem ridiculous to call a witch that can make fireballs the size of trees precise, but no other word does her justice. It reminds me of a finely honed blade, of an anvil strike, of the ticking clock in tune with the entire realm. It fills me with awe and fear. Just who is this master pyromancer?
>
> Entry 9:
> My master has once again revealed more of her past. Most shockingly, she lowered her cloak and revealed herself to be a Drehmari! One without horns, to boot. She says she has lived in this swamp for hundreds of years, and lived longer on Drehmal before that.
>
> I know little about Drehmari biology, but I'm almost certain they die long before that. Not only that, her face was that of a young woman, showing no signs of age at all. She says it's nothing to worry about, but I don't know how true that is. Every day I spend with her is another mystery.
>
> Entry 10:
> It has been two years since I entered the service of my master. It was not an easy two years, but I know that I have grown by leaps and bounds since I started my journey. My master says I am now ready to leave and return to my clan, but I know I still have so much to learn.
>
> She never even told me her name.

## Trivia
The Drehmari pyromancer referenced in this book cannot be found in-game. She is based on an OC named Nemeta by Drehmal developer greenTetrahedron.
