# Lorahn'Kahl

![[LK_landscape1.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Lorahn'Kahl** (pronounced "lore-on-call") is a forested, tropical region on the southern coast of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Its name comes from [[Rihselch]], with "Lorahn" referring to the [[Lorahn|moon of the same name]] and "Kahl" being an unknown root.

## Geography

Lorahn'Kahl makes up a section of land along the western south coast of the continent. The region borders [[Palisades Heath]] to the north, the [[South Heartwood]] to the northeast, [[South Tharxax]] to the northwest, and [[The Carmine|the Carmine]] to the west. 

Lorahn'Kahl is a tropical forest, with trees of jungle wood and birch (the latter for aesthetic purposes). The terrain is also home to bluffs and natural spires with blue and cyan stone. In the north are some areas that are more grassy with less trees, and on the coast in the south and east are wide, sand beaches. A few islands also inhabit the waters offshore. The sea appears brighter around Lorahn'Kahl due to its biome configuration as a warm ocean.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- Grassy areas with few trees, spread around region, mainly in north <br>
- The Moonspires, an area with winding network of canyons and waterways with steep, blue-and-cyan striped cliffs, in west <br>
- Area with bluffs with blue-and-cyan striped cliffs on southwest coast

The town of [[Mohta]] sits on the tip of a peninsula in the region's east.

## History

In the early Second Avihm, Lorahn'Kahl was inhabited by a people known as the "Kahlans", who maintained trade with the [[Ancient Drehua]] people to the north.

The region's history throughout the following centuries is unknown, but some time in the late Av2 1300s or 1400s, outcast [[Necromancy|necromancers]] from the [[Chosen Kingdom]] migrated to Lorahn'Kahl and assembled under the leadership of Saint Raene. This was the foundation of the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], which worshiped the trio of [[Lorahn]], [[Loruhn]], and [[LD|Lo'Dahr]].

The Tri-Moon Theocracy existed without major disturbance for centuries, before conflicts with the [[Empire of Maelihs]] to the west quickly escalated. The Theocracy raised a fearsome, undead army in response, prompting the neighboring [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]], already their sworn enemy, to eliminate the Tri-Moon Theocracy's High Priests and annex Lorahn'Kahl, preventing Mael from seizing the region. The undead army then broke loose and wreaked havoc on the area, posing a major threat to the local population and forcing them to defend themselves. The "Undead Horde" was eventually disposed of after grueling efforts from Avsohm.

After [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm collapsed]], Maelihs attempted to claim Lorahn'Kahl. His armies were able to successfully conquer part of the region, but were held off by resistance in some other areas such as the town of Mohta. Mohta's forces were able to kill an attacking [[Burnt Generals|Burnt General]] during an invasion. 

The [[Insohm|Insohmic Coalition]] liberated the region in the [[Battle for Drehmal]], and one or more member states may have been granted territorial control over the land. However, Insohm soon crumbled, and Maelihs's soldiers returned to retake the area. As of today, his empire only extends into a small portion of the region, on its western edge. 

Mohta once again stands under threat of attack, and is the only remaining settlement in the area.

## Terminus Tower

> The Lorahn'Kahl tower.

Lorahn'Kahl's Terminus tower is situated in the middle of a small, mostly-enclosed bay in the region's geographical center, connected to the ocean via a narrow strait. It stands next to a blue and cyan rock jutting out of the water. A prismarine staircase leads to the top of this rock, and a bridge joins its summit to a point on the tower's midsection. The way is guarded by hostile Moonborn Constructs (Guardians), Undead Theocracy Sentinels (skeletons), and an Undead Theocracy Warden (witch).

## Points of Interest

### Mohta

[[Mohta]] is an [official town](/World/Drehmal/Settlements/Official_Towns/) located on a beach peninsula in southeastern Lorahn'Kahl. Its architecture uses a circular, stilted structure, mostly composed of jungle wood, with domed, prismarine roofs. The town is fortified by a wooden wall that cuts across the peninsula, shielding it from the inland. Mohta was founded by survivors after the reign of the Tri-Moon Theocracy, and it has long been subject to persistent attacks from [[Maelmari]] troops.

### Moonlight Sanctum

The [[Moonlight Sanctum]] is a group of Necrotic Engines concealed deep in a watery, underground cavern. They were used by the Tri-Moon Theocracy millennia ago but are yet to be found and destroyed. The structure is still heavily guarded by powerful, undead soldiers, and holds the [[Ascendance]] mythical weapon.

### Necromantic Church

Nestled underground in the Moonspires (and beneath the ribcage of a [[Skullbeasts|Skullbeast]] in the cave above) is a small, church-like chamber built for a congregation of lunar necromancers. It was the site at which Saint Raene first called out to all necromancers to assemble in Lorahn'Kahl, and it is also the place where the officials of the Tri-Moon Theocracy met for the last time and officially dissolved the state. Its entrance can be found in a cliffside by following the trail of prismarine torches through the labyrinth of canyons in the region's west, starting from the ruins of Sal'Lorahn.

### Ruins of Eloa

[[Eloa]] was once a city in central Lorahn'Kahl, and it was most likely self-governed by the House of Ayre, a royal family of [[Tahva|Tahvan]] descendance. They would have only held control for a brief period of time between Avsohm's fall and the area's conquest by Maelihs. Eventually, they were freed by Insohm. It is unclear whether the city was placed under the rule of a certain Insohmic member state or the House of Ayre was granted autonomous power, but Maelihs's military was soon to return and assert control once again. This resulted in the city being abandoned by its people, who all dispersed to other nearby cities. Eloa's expansive ruins can still be found today.

### Ruins of Sal'Lorahn

[[Sal'Lorahn]], meaning "city of Lorahn", was the grand capital city of the Tri-Moon Theocracy, overlooking the shore in the region's western half. The specifics of its history are unknown, but it was probably left in a deserted state of destruction after being overrun in the Undead Horde's rampage.
