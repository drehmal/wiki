## Transcription
> Ohhh kindred! Spirits of the howling gale, do come to me. Children of the endless storm, beloved of the blizzard. Our brothers and sisters, sit down, sit down. There is a warm pyre here for you. Come to my circle, if only for a night. I do not fear, I cannot. Frostfang tribesmen never fear.
>
> We have ICE in our bones, so do we, so we do. I tell you, ancestors, your deaths were not in vain! Though Avsohm made it to the mountain of holes, they too were stricken. By the fearful lord of the void! Ohhh Tethlaen, have mercy on our hardened souls. Our salvation will come.
>
> We must only endure. See! You seem glad of his blessings, brother. Though it is hard to tell when you lack a jaw, I suppose. But I can see the joy in your eye. Hah! Let us laugh together! Three, no four of us are here now. Four brave warriors of the North. Though the last cinders are fading, now, they say the clan makes the party, not the hearth. Strike me down if you must. Go on, gnaw at my leg. A Frostfang tribesman knows no fear! Lord of the Void, take us! Take us now!!!
