# avSYS

**avSYS** is a virtual entity that operates multiple [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] technological systems. It appears frequently throughout the story, communicating through chat and directing the player through the storyline.

## Lore

avSYS was created as a project by Avsohmic programmers including [[Gohri Zed]] during the reign of [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]], and was considered to be one of Avsohm's most impressive inventions. It was designed to substitute manual work in maintaining the empire's complex technology. avSYS was sometimes used to operate home appliances (such as heating) for the wealthy.

## Role in Story

avSYS will speak to the player whenever they first activate a [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus Tower]], updating them on their tower completion percentage. The first time players warp to the Terminus, they will be greeted by avSYS recognizing their clearance level and granting access to the Terminus. avSYS will inform the player that towers need to be manually re-linked on-site, and provide a compass pointing to [[Av'Sal]] from the compass dispensary in the southern wing.

avSYS will then go on to tell the player to visit story locations at the appropriate tower percentages, gifting compasses that lead to those respective story locations once their holotext databases can be restored.

avSYS is present in almost all Avsohmic locations, and also provides some other messages beyond simple instructions.
