# Major Aspects

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

Out of the 20 Aspects, 8 are considered to be Major Aspects, with dominion over extremely broad areas of reality and significantly more power than the Minor Aspects. The Major Aspects are also the oldest of the Aspects, having been created by the [[Primal Tree]] in Av1.

The four **Elder Aspects**—[[Khive]], [[Rihelma]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]]—are the oldest, wisest, and most powerful of the Aspects. They are Major Aspects, but are especially revered.

The other four Major Aspects—[[Lai]], [[Loe]], [[Vayniklah]], and [[Voynahla]]—are also incredibly powerful, but are not among the Elder Aspects.
