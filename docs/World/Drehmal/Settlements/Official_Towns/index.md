# Official Towns

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

Official Towns are settlements which give special [[advancements]] under the "Discovery" tab when found, have their own custom soundtrack, and are home to merchants including an [[Adventuring Merchant]], a [[Runic Blacksmith]], and other specialized traders. No regions have more than one, and some regions do not have an official town at all, as there are only 14 on Drehmal.

All official towns have a single in-game map placed in item frames, which shows a layout of the town with banners marking points of interest. These maps also always have a crafting table and a Primal Cache at their sides.
