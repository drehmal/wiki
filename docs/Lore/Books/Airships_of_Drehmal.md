## Transcription
> Ever since Professor Hemfihl reverse engineered Mael's airship technology in Av3 509, the people of Drehmal have been changed for the better with far more convenient trading and travelling.
>
> Airships were first used by powerful trading companies starting in Av3 512, which allowed them to control huge sections of the economy. This was beneficial to Drehmari kind for a time, before these companies started to influence politics to their benefit. This is what eventually led to the Order of Insohm's first major war, the Insohmic Trade Wars.
>
> During this time, merchant fleets were repurposed into battleships. This is the first time since the Dune Wars that airships were used for fighting.
>
> The Order of Insohm began constructing a fleet of battleships to be used in future wars and the eventual Battle for Drehmal, where all of the eastern nations united to take back the west from Maelihs.
>
> The pride and joy of this fleet is the I.C.S Arbiter, which was constructed using Avsohmic technology. This magnificent flying machine was used during the Battle for Drehmal as a mobile center of government to make quicker, more informed decisions.
>
> Maelihs has his own fleet of airships but not much is known about them. They were used primarily in the Dune Wars to decimate the resistance.
>
> Avsohm also had their own expansive fleet, but most of these have either been dismantled for parts or lost to time. There has been a search since the dawn of the Third Avihm to find the crown jewel of their fleet, but not a single trace of it has been found. This airship, called the Aphelion, was said to house the throne of the Avsohmic emperors. It is said that an untold wealth of knowledge is aboard the ship, as well as powerful technology that would be greatly beneficial to Drehmal as a whole. It is believed that the airship is somewhere at the bottom of the ocean, as no ground expeditions have been able to find its wreckage. There are still adventurers who wish to find the Aphelion and claim its wealth. There have also been reports of Maelihs' army going on expeditions to locate the airship. We hope that the airship is never found or that the power within falls into the wrong hands.
