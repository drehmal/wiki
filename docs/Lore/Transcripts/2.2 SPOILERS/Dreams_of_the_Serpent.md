The following is a transcript of the Dreams of the Serpent, a dialogue sequence that plays during the player's first time entering the Tower of Drehmal in [[Ytaj]]. This sequence finds the player seemingly joining in on the [[Drehmal|Realmbinder]]'s dream, while being directly addressed by them.

Lines alternate between the in-game chat, which present as cues to the player to represent the feeling of the dream, and direct dialogue from Drehmal at the top of the screen.

In this transcript, the in-game chat dialogue is written in *\*italics, surrounded by asterisks*\*, while Drehmal's dialogue is written in **bold**.

## Transcription
> *\*Dreams echo through your body and mind...*\*
>
> **In the absence of silence there is change. Change is good.**
>
> *\*You picture grand branches weaving against a perfectly black void.*\*
>
> **I grew tired of silence. I wanted change. I wanted noise.**
>
> *\*Twenty-three flowers blossom within your mind.*\*
>
> **But noise brings entropy. Chaos. Even in perfection she is still a product of it. Do we call that irony?**
>
> *\*You feel the intense heat of vile flame. For a fleeting moment, a surge of rage overwhelms you.*\*
>
> **I carry much sympathy for my scorched brother. He has been victimized the most by entropy though we are all born of it. Is his pain, and the pain he inflicts, worth the cost of creation?**
>
> *\*Tendril-like roots spread out through your feet. You are connected to everything.*\*
>
> **I could not guide the people. I could only provide them with creation. Perhaps if I could have been a guide I may have saved the realm from its pain…**
>
> *\*Dew-kissed leaves fall all around you.*\*
>
> **Ah, but pain and entropy are merely inevitabilities of creation. One cannot have joy without pain. There would be no experience without it. Only silence. I am grateful to exist. I am grateful for change.**
>
> *\*Your heart palpitates briefly.*\*
>
> **Without change I would not exist alongside my siblings. Nor would the humble Drehmari who sought my guidance in those early days.**
>
> *\*The moons align in impossibility.*\*
>
> **The time I spent mending the world, binding and reshaping … solely performing all tasks of those who blossomed before me… it was greatly taxing.**
>
> *\*Moss-green scales cover your skin.*\*
>
> **I hold the memories of the one before and I dream as the one before. Yet I am not. I am merely an inheritor.**
>
> *\*Your heart is a rose.*\*
>
> **Sometimes I wonder if my siblings ever dream as I do. We are parts of the same whole. Do they see themselves as the one before the same way as I? Do they share these memories of our time as a whole before the collapse?**
>
> *\*Your teeth are fangs.*\*
>
> **Perhaps it is because I took so much from the one before that I see myself as the same.**
>
> *\*Your legs are one.*\*
>
> **Was I chosen or was it a mere coincidence?**
>
> *\*Your pupils are slitted.*\*
>
> **What would have become of the realm if I were not there in my primordial form?**
>
> *\*Your heart blossoms.*\*
>
> **Let me dream of something else.**
>
> *\*You return to your familiar form.*\*
>
> **I want to dream of my awakening.**
>
> *\*The sands of time flow through your fingers.*\*
>
> **I will emerge from my cavern, my resting place of millennia.**
>
> *\*Atop your shoulders are three peaks: blue, red and green. The weight feels good.*\*
>
> **I will stretch my body, slither through the valley and feel the grasses brush against my scales.**
>
> *\*The warmth of sunlight caresses your cheek.*\*
>
> **I will happen upon a Drehmari. They will welcome me back.**
>
> *\*You feel the delight of recognizing an old friend amongst a sea of strangers.*\*
>
> **Our meeting will be good. I will bow my head and they will rest their hand against my snout.**
>
> *\*Scales brush against your hand.*\*
>
> **Together we will live out our days until silence takes hold once more.**
>
> *\*Your chest rumbles. You feel at ease.*\*
>
> **It will be wonderful.**
>
> *\*The echoes of dreams fade away.*\*
