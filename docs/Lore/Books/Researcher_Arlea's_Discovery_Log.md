## Transcription
> ENTRY ONE: I've discovered a strange effect that corresponds to a certain class of runes, those which transmute materials. It seems that for the briefest of moments, the affected object takes on the appearance of its future version before actually physically transforming. Curious.
>
> ENTRY TWO: When I mentioned the glitch to her on a routine visit, CSO Thresa's eyes lit up, and she immediately called over Senior Researcher Vehmil. I cannot say I am terribly pleased about my work station being taken over, but Vehmil seemed so excited that I felt compelled to let him take my place. I hope I will get a cut of any profit that comes from MY discovery!
>
> ENTRY THREE: Sal'Mevir has been completely recommissioned by the DoS, with Vehmil in charge and myself second-in-command! We combined his stasis technology with my findings to create what we are calling the "Temporal Engine". The device projects future visions of Sal'Mevir to the mind of an observer, although the energy demand necessitates that tests only last a few minutes.
