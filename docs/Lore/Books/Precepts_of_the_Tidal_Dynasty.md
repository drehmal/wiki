## Transcription
> Precepts of the Tidal Dynasty:
>
> 1. Mind the tides. Take territory when the ocean falls away, and reinforce what you have when it rises again.
>
> 2. Make peace with the powerful. Be a stalwart friend to those who could crush you until you can crush them.
>
> 3. In times of rebellion, start a war. Direct revolution outwards.
>
> 4. Nothing sticks in the memory like fire. Use it sparingly to set an example.
>
> 5. If you can afford to, trust only those who owe you a life debt and to whom you have given great riches.
