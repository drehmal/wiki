### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in [[Firteid]]. It discusses the mysterious origin of [[Green Serpent]], and the organization's role within Avsohm.

### Transcription:
> The origin of Green Serpent is mysterious, even amongst its siblings. It existed as the commercial and economic branch of the Avsohmic Empire's (nominally) unaffiliated "Big Three", Green Serpent held major influence over all aspects of the Avsohmic economy. Little was known about the inner circle of the group; members were anonymous and only did business with the Avsohmic Senate through a myriad of intermediaries. One thing is certain: it was both tight-knit and centuries old, likely pre-dating the reign of Drehn. Some even posit ancient Drehua connections.
>
> Despite this distance, Green Serpent and the Avsohmic Empire quickly became deeply entwined. Blue Exodus protects Green Serpent convoys carrying Red Dawn shipments, and so on. That same distance gave Green Serpent a means of insulation from the fall of Avsohm, allowing them to persist far beyond the rest as a major trading conglomerate, adventurer's guild, and trusted information broker.
>
> The many adventuring merchants of Drehmal sleep well knowing that the indomitable commercial strength of Green Serpent protects them.
