## Transcription
> The Casain ethnicity is an offshoot of the Ebohni tribe (direct descendants are called Ebonfolk), a group centered in the present-day Ebony Veldt and Southern Casai. They interacted a lot with the tribes around them, mostly the Ebohni but occasionally Merians (tribes of Merijool) and Tharhans.
>
> What made the Casain tribes stand out from the rest was their general peacefulness, especially those at the tip of the peninsula. While the climate was dry and the sand unfit for farming, the central valley along the peninsula had the perfect conditions for large expanses of farmland. The development of agriculture made the tribes in Casai much more advanced than any group before it, beaten only by the city-states of the Central Plains.
>
> Eventually, dense communities began to form, growing in size until they had a semblance of rulership and government. The first among them was Athrah.
