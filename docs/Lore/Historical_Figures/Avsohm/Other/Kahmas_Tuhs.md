# Kahmas Tuhs

**Kahmas Tuhs** was an elite [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] general, and the head of [[Blue Exodus]]. He was frozen in temporal stasis at the [[Stasis Facility]], and his pod appears to have opened several years before the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Stasis_Eight/). It is unclear if he is still alive somewhere in the realm.

Kahmas is one of the most prominent confirmed [[Virmari]] characters in the map, showcasing the degree of Virmari integration into Avsohm's power structure.

## Appearance

An official reference sheet for Kahmas was commissioned and released in August 2025 on the Drehmal Patreon. It was released to the public in January 2026.

> Kahmas' official reference sheet.

Kahmas is shown as a heavily-built, middle-aged man with a pale complexion, light blonde hair, crystalline blue eyes, and crystalline light blue ram-style horns, reminiscent of diamond or ice. He is notably covered in runic tattoos and scars, referencing his past as a formidable arcanist.

Kahmas is notably listed at a towering height of 7'2", far above the average height of both humans and [[Drehmari]] (accepted to be roughly equivalent). Concept Artist HiscottiBiscotti has stated that this reflects a trend of growth in post-ascension [[Virmari]], in which they often grow up to a foot after being ascended.

## History

Kahmas was a long-lived individual, born during the late reign of [[Drehn]] and being an active force in Avsohmic politics through the reigns of [[Ifeihl]] and [[Anyr]]. His first known escapades were in the [[Divine Schism]], where he was personally hand-picked by Glacial Elder [[Loe]] to lead an Anti-Palaesidan siege of the Aspects' palace, serving as a leader in that army despite being one of the very few non-[[Tehrmari]] involved in the conflict.

Kahmas arose to become the Commander of the military organization [[Blue Exodus]] at some point, and appears to have held this position at the time of Avsohm's fall in Av2 1820, nearly 200 years after his service in the Schism. 

Kahmas appears to have had a significant role in the forging of the [[Mythbreaker]], especially in its separation and containment following the actual process. There are records of him visiting several Avsohmic facilities, as his name appears frequently on holotexts in story locations, including [[Exodus Vault]], [[Av'Sal]], and the [[Numencore]].

Just prior to the [[Fall of Avsohm]], Kahmas was one of the important Avsohmic officers who was brought to the [[Stasis Facility]] and frozen in time as the empire collapsed. He was located in Pod #10.

## Stasis

Based on a [[stasis_info.md|holotext in the Stasis Facility]], it appears that Kahmas' pod was opened first, 17 years before the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Stasis_Eight/). In-game, his pod is open and empty. There is no clear information concerning to what happened to Kahmas, whether he is still alive somewhere or even managed to make it out of the facility.


## Extras

In July 2025, co-lead developer DomeMaster revealed that Kahmas Tuhs was, in fact, a [[Virmari]], confirmed by his later reference sheet. While this information is not corroborated anywhere in 2.2, it is possible that his character may be expanded upon in future updates.
