## History

The Empire of Maelihs is not an explicitly named state, but since the dawn of Av2, there has always been some portion of the western continent that is entirely under the jurisdiction of the chaos deity. This has seemingly always included the [[Maelmari]] homelands of the [[Hellcrags]] and [[The Carmine]].

This empire was one of two major combatants in the [[Deity War]], fighting against the unified forces of [[Virtuo]] to the east. Practically no details are known on this war besides that it lasted until Av2 1000, and was highly bloody, becoming the standard for extreme loss of life in warfare for the rest of the realm's history.

The empire fought many smaller skirmishes against [[Avsohm]] during their period of dominance, but this conflict never seemed to erupt into full-scale war. Immediately following the [[Fall of Avsohm]], Mael launched an assault on the disoriented western states, capturing [[Sal'Anyr]] and beginning the [[Dune Wars]].

Immediately following the Dune Wars, the Empire seems to have been at its territorial peak, including the Tharhan Plains, [[Lorahn'Kahl]], [[Nimahj Swamp]], [[Anyr'Nogur]], [[Mt. Ebonfire]], the [[Ebony Veldt]], likely [[Casai]], and potentially even [[Merijool]]. It held these territories until the [[Battle for Drehmal]] in late Av3, in which [[Insohm]] was able to reclaim almost all of this land, pushing Mael's forces back into the Hellcrags.

However, Insohm dissolved as well at the end of Av3, with the flight of Virtuo leaving the Order without a leader. While the Burnt Lord's heart was no longer fully dedicated to world domination, his forces reclaimed most of the west, stopping short of Casai to the far northwest. These boundaries are what remain of Mael's empire today.

With Mael's departure, the [[Burnt Generals]] are effectively the rulers of the west.
