> N/A
>
> Test Group 1:
> 15 volunteers, randomly selected
>
> Method:

>
> 7 subjects unaffected
>
> 3 subjects experienced sensations of numbness at aprox. 30 minutes post ingestion to 1 hour post ingestion
>
> Test Group 2:
> 15 volunteers, randomly selected
>
> Method:
> Seeds crushed and injected into the blood stream
>
> Results:

> Notes:
> I wasn’t sure if I should write this, but I am at my wit’s end. Four months of nothing but lab work, and a willing volunteer dies testing the microseeds. It is absolutely the joy and pleasure of my life to serve you, my Emperor, but I can feel my body falling apart and my memory failing. Don’t get me wrong, I love Avsohm. I was the youngest to earn a doctorate in the history of our empire or the Chosen Kingdom. I worked for Blue Exodus, the DoS, and now Red Dawn on your recommendation. I have met so many amazing friends and colleagues throughout the years. You have even given me an opportunity and funding to pursue my life’s goal with this project! Being taken away from my family and into the labs was the best thing that has ever happened to me for so many reasons. But I am scared. I am so scared. I feel Voynahla’s hand gripping my wrist. If I can’t trust my mind and my memory, what can I trust anymore? I need to go. So therefore, though it may be selfish, please transfer me away for a time. I cannot stand being underground for a moment longer. Although I would love to work with Kovis again, or Vehmil, I absolutely cannot stay at Red Dawn. Please, Your Divine Excellency.
