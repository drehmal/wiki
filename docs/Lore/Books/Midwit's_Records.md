> Ima smartest one here, so boss put me on writing duty. Says we gots to keep records for the army. Well, we started buildin' this place a few years back, and I had the idea to make it look like a mountain, to trick the stupid pale ones. Plan is if we see any of 'em comin', we light the fire and let Rhaveloth know. That way, they can get all prepared, and beat the tar outta anyone who thinks it's a good idea to mess with us!
