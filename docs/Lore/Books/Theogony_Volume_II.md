## Transcription
> The Aspects are minor gods that assisted the Primal Tree in the creation of the realm before Av2. They no longer have much influence over the realm, as they wish not to interfere anymore. All of them are reptilian in some way, many of them taking the form of great winged beasts.
>
> The Aspects are broadly split into two groups, the Major Aspects and the Minor Aspects. The exact location of this division has been the subject of much theological debate. Theogony Volume II will discuss the Major Aspects, while Volume III will discuss the Minor ones.
>
> There is also a distinction between the Great Aspects and the other Major Aspects. This is also a strange distinction, but one constructed by the Aspects themselves. Most scholars assume it signifies power and seniority amongst the Aspects, with the four Great Aspects being far more powerful than the others.
>
> Mystic Elder Khive, Great Arcane Aspect
> -------------------
> Khive is the Great Aspect who created Runic Magic, and gifted the power of the arcane to mortals. Considered the most powerful Aspect, Khive strictly stays out of the affairs of Drehmari. Few have ever seen his visage.
>
> Abyssal Elder Dahr, Great Sea Aspect
> -------------------
> Dahr brought water to the realm and filled the ocean basins. He is considered the King of the Aspects, and lords over the Prismatic Council, the governing body of the mysterious land which the Aspects call home: The moon of Lo'Dahr.
>
> Land-Fall Drake Taihgel, Great Land Aspect
> -------------------
> Taihgel created the land and continents, and is described as a massive earthen turtle. Despite its size, it is known to be a gentle and caring Elder, who often counsels other Aspects for advice.
>
> Star-Rise Drake Rihelma, Great Sky Aspect
> -------------------
> Rihelma created the skies, the clouds, and most things above our heads. She keeps the moons in their orbits, and is often known to give out enigmatic prophecies in the form of "Facets".
>
> Brightwyrm Lai, Aspect of Warmth
> -------------------
> Lai brought the joy of warmth into our lives, and reflects that warmth in his sunny disposition. Lai is by far the most cheerful and accommodating Aspect, and is known for his easy-going nature even amongst mortals.
>
> Glacial Elder Loe, Aspect of Cold
> -------------------
> Despite what one may think, Loe is not a cold-hearted or cruel Aspect. In fact, she is quite jolly! However, she is known to keep a grudge, with she and Lai having a fierce rivalry, both dropping the friendly façade to fiercely debate.
>
> Life-Bringer Vayniklah, Aspect of Life
> -------------------
> Vayniklah’s domain has steadily eroded over time. Originally given the power to create life and heal souls, she could not create complex forms, but is still respected and venerated realmwide.
>
> Soul-Stealer Voynahla, Aspect of Death
> -------------------
> Voynahla is a much reviled Aspect with dominion over death itself. During the Divine Schism, Voynahla took his own life. Due to his power over death, however, he has continued to linger in our realm.
