## Transcription
> Attention, spectators. The Speakers of the Sepulchral Altar would like to thank you for attending todayâ€™s Ascension. On behalf of the Burnt Generals, we ask that you leave offerings at the many other **statues of Maelihs throughout His domain** instead of coming to the sanctum after the ritual. Thank you.
