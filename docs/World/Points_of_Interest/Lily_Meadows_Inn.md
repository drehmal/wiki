## Layout/Contents

The building's main entrance, at the coordinates above, leads directly to a small booth with a "Receptionist" trader. This trader offers multiple very good deals on cooked food. Unlike most custom traders in Drehmal, this villager is not AI-less, and does move around, although they are confined to this booth.
