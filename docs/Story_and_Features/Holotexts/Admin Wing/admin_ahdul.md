## Transcription:
> Our discovery of **Him-Beyond** spurned Lord Anyr into a frenzy. He swiftly promoted me, and granted immense funding unto Red Dawn which will allow us to accomplish goals our order has been pursuing for centuries. **Apotheosis** will be the most important work Red Dawn has ever done. Its centerpiece will be our grandest creation: a machine to rival the Aspects and Deities themselves.
