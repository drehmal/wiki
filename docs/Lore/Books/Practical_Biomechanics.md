## Transcription
> The most common use of Alchemical Sciences in the modern day is the use of Practical Biomechanics. PB, as it is sometimes known, is the use of Alchemy (specifically biologic fields in the Hermetic school) to produce everyday materials, often in mass quantity. For instance, the dark oaken wood found throughout this very school was made via the use of Practical Biomechanics! When regular oak wood is fully infused with a concocted brew of specific reagents, the strength of the wood is greatly increased, and it becomes almost entirely resistant to mold, wood lice, and other decomposers!
