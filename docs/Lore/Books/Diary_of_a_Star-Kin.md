## Transcription
> Oh, to be abandoned twice in a century! On the very centennial of which we were celebrating, Rihelma blessed us with her presence. She sadly informed us that she must leave for the moon of Lo'Veruhkt, and unlike before, she would not return to grace us again. Her reasoning was obtuse, as is expected. She cited "coming times of great turmoil", and "the unfurling of what we all hold dear". These prophecies are simply terrifying. Many begged her to stay and protect us, but alas! She claimed that not even the Elder Aspects were safe from what is to come.
