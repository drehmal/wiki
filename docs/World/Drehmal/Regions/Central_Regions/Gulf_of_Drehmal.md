# Gulf of Drehmal

![[Gulf_of_Drehmal.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Gulf of Drehmal** is a region in central [[Overworld|Drehmal]] forming the northern section of the Central Plains (Dreh'Noha). The landscape is similar to that of [[Capital Valley]] to the south, being mostly temperate plains and woods. It is named after the Gulf of Drehmal, a large body of water to the north that forms a coastline with the region.

## Geography

The Gulf of Drehmal region sits between the Gulf of Drehmal directly to the north, Capital Valley to the south, [[Merijool]] to the west and [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and [[Purity Peaks]] to the east.

The region's landscape consists mostly of grasslands and oak and birch woods. The terrain is less flat than Capital Valley, with many bluffs with granite cliffs and rock formations. There are also sandy beaches lining the north coast, and a small swamp in the west. Rivers from Akhlo'Rohma and Purity Peaks to the east conjoin and flow into an inlet in the middle of the region's coast.

There are no sizable settlements in the Gulf of Drehmal.

## History

In the early Second Avihm, the Gulf of Drehmal region was home to primitive Dreh'Nohan city states. Among these was Drahbes, which through unclear means (likely by conquest) expanded into the [[Chosen Kingdom]].

Eventually, under the leadership of [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], the kingdom became the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]]. The coastal city of Fortahn in particular flourished under the empire's rule, but was left in ruins after its [[Fall of Avsohm|collapse]].

In the Third Avihm, the [[United Townships of Dreh'Noha]] arose as the regional political power. It was a member of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] until the latter's collapse at the end of the Avihm. The union still exists today.

The Gulf of Drehmal's Terminus tower sits half-submerged in the middle of the coast's central inlet. A sinking boat full of [[Mihkmari]] that had crashed into the tower floats adjacent to it.

## Points of Interest

### Astorahnni Tower

The Astorahnni Tower is a tall, pointed tower in the region's northwest. It is inhabited by the hostile Sun Apostles, members of the Order of Astorahn. The Order of Astorahn was created in West Merijool on the foundation of the [[Torahn]] being the world's true source of warmth, as opposed to [[Lai]], Aspect of Warmth. Due to the Astorahnni's beliefs, which contradicted those of the Lai-worshiping people of West Merijool, they were banished from the land and they resettled in the Gulf of Drehmal region.

### Ruins of Drahbes

Drahbes was the greatest city state of the many that populated Dreh'Noha in the early Second Avihm. It was this civilizaton that gave way to the Chosen Kingdom and ultimately the Empire of Avsohm. Today, the ruins of their immense, walled city and large royal ziggurat, all built from brick, granite and concrete, remain on the eastern edge of the region, bordering on the [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and [[Purity Peaks]] regions. Outside of the ruins is a small settlement with houses of grass and wood.

### Ruins of Fortahn

Fortahn was a major Avsohmic-era city that sat along a river delta feeding into the Gulf of Drehmal. The city was destroyed by the forces that caused the Fall of Avsohm, and despite an attempt to hide and barricade everyone, its people were massacred. The sprawling stone-brick-and-quartz ruins are still visible today.
