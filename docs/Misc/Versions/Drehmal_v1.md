**Drehmal v1**, also known as **Drehmal: Legacy**, is the first public release of a Drehmal Minecraft map, published to Planet Minecraft on October 27, 2017. It is compatible with Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12.1.

At a glance, this world is somewhat reminiscent of modern Drehmal, with most of the current map's biomes existing in some capacity. However, the continent takes a different shape, and is only 8,000 by 8,000 blocks in size compared to the 12,000 by 12,000 block modern map. Additionally, there is minimal content beyond the terrain. There is no main story, and the map lacks any of the intricate lore, gameplay systems, or structures of later versions of the map. The only towns on the map are early versions of [[Ebonrun]], [[Drabyel]], and [[Mossfield]].

As it does not contain a true main story or questline, Drehmal: Legacy can only be "finished" in the same way that vanilla Minecraft can be: by defeating the Ender Dragon. Unfortunately, the publicly available version of Drehmal v1 does not contain an end portal, as the wrong version of the world folder was uploaded. The end portal would have been located in Mt. Yavhlix.
