## Characteristics

Palaesida's passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] reads:

> Tempest Palaesida, Aspect of Storms
> ***
> Child of Dahr and Rihelma who was killed in the Divine Schism by Abominate Maen.

Palaesida is generally depicted as a rebellious and mischievous Aspect.

Palaesida is one of only two Aspects who is explicitly shown to be the child of two other Aspects, being a cross between [[Dahr]], Aspect of Sea, and [[Rihelma]], Aspect of Sky. The only other such Aspect is [[Noha]], a cross between [[Taihgel]] and [[Vayniklah]].

## In-Map References

There are few early-game references to Palaesida, although one artifact, [[Artifacts#Boltcatcher's Cradle|Boltcatcher's Cradle]], found in the [[Frozen Bite]], is imbued with his power.

Palaesida is one of the most frequently mentioned Aspects on [[Lo'Dahr]], with a [[Palaesida's Domain|domain]] in the southeastern portion of the moon and a central role in the moon's lore.

Palaesida's room in [[Ytaj]], pictured above, is home to a series of signs that tell a fuller story of the [[Divine Schism]], heavily implicating him in the event. Palaesida, alongside [[Loeleyhn]] and [[Rihalae]], devised a plan to steal the [[Frostfang]] from [[Lai]] and [[Loe]], gifting it to [[Homli Tahsgan]] on Drehmal as an act of mischief. This would result in the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], which in turn led to [[Noha]] taking her own life. The other Aspects, furious at the trio for inadvertently killing one of their own, aligned against Palaesida and his allies, beginning the war that would come to be known as the Divine Schism.

During the conflict, Palaesida's side was known as the Palaesidans. They captured Ytaj in the First Battle of Ytaj, and held the palace until the Second Battle of Ytaj, where a siege from the anti-Palaesidans led by [[Rihelma]] and [[Oriann]] nearly captured it. A negotiation was held between the sides in the [[Lunar Wastes]] just outside of Ytaj, where Palaesida was murdered by [[Maen]], holding a grudge over a perceived past transgression. Maen was exiled, marking the end of the Schism.

Palaesida's corpse was interred within his domain, but at some point in the following centuries, his bones mysteriously arose, turning the entirety of his domain into a perpetual thunderstorm.

Here, at the Heart of the Tempest, Palaesida's skeleton can be found, with the [[Thundercrux]] legendary chestplate, once worn by Palaesida's [[Tehrmari]] champion and closest mortal friend, [[Amohn Aihura]]. 

Some more details are clear about Palaesida's physical form from his skeleton. He had the basic form of a standard dragon, with large wings and a long tail. He also appears to have lightning rod spikes along his spine, which may represent spikes that actually conducted electricity when he lived.
