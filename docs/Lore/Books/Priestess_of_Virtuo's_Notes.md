### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest at the Parish of Virtuo in [[Highfall]], expressing dissent against the worship of [[Virtuo]] as opposed to more traditional worship of [[Tethlaen]] in the far north.

### Transcription:
> I'm sick and tired of this day-by-day worship of Virtuo, the goddess who has abandoned us. My ancestors refused to worship her for a reason, and a good reason it was. In the north, Tethlaen worship is far more common, but in Highfall, they are blinded by a false hope of peace and prosperity, despite there being none since the dawn of the realm.
>
> They always tell me that I'll be executed for my words against the city's faith, but I do not care. They are insane fanatics. They tell me that Tethlaen is dead, fell off the face of the realm. I don't believe it. Why would a deity die in such a simple manner? They must be hiding out, or they wish not to engage in Drehmari affairs, given how simple minded we can be.
>
> Maybe, sometime in the future, I can rebuild the old Chapel of Tethlaen. But that won't happen as long as our current ruler is in charge.
