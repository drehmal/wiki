An update to follow the colossal [[Drehmal v22|Apotheosis update]] has long been considered, but was not immediately started on after the release of 2.2 due to developer time conflicts. It was formally announced in a [blog post on the five-year anniversary of Drehmal v2](https://www.drehmal.net/post/five-years-of-drehmal), following the addition of multiple new members to the dev team.

## Content

The exact content of the 2.3 update is, as per usual for the Drehmal dev team, not public information. However, developers have spoken informally on the kind of content that players can expect in 2.3.

Broadly, the 2.3 update is expected to bring old material that was not touched in 2.2 up to the higher standards of the full team. Teaser images have also shown new builds and terrain overhauls, with [[Spearhead Forest]] and an unclear biome receiving terrain updates, as well as settlements. The team has expressed a desire to "push 2.3's technical side to the limit", increasing the complexity of the datapack and the gameplay features it controls. New lore additions are expected as well, particularly in areas that the team and community feel are under-utilized or poorly represented in 2.2, such as the exploits of [[Green Serpent]] and the role of [[Mihkmari]] in the realm.

The [[Archived Memory]] is very likely to be a teaser for 2.3, hinting at a terrain rework for the [[North Heartwood]] and a completely new lore wrinkle.
