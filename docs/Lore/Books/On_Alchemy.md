## Transcription
> Alchemy is the study of truth. While arcanists conquer the land and artificers seek to fill their own pockets, alchemists pursue wisdom and the betterment of their souls.
>
> What nobler pursuit exists than that of understanding? It is to discover what the purpose is of our existence so that we all can fulfill that purpose.
>
> Like all schools of magic, one must first master the basic runes. Calligraphy, carving, painting all are essential for the novice practitioner. In addition, one must learn to meditate, to to feel the inner mechanisms of one’s body work as one slips into a state of perfectly relaxed concentration.
>
> Next, the skillful apprentice must train with plants. Even the tiniest runic catalyst can become a mixture of great potency when combined with the correct biological components. One must learn the function of each ingredient, and commit those functions to memory.
>
> Then, they should move to beasts. Dissect and learn the function of each organ. Use a specialized Locate rune to detect the location of the soul. And once again, discover the function of each component.
>
> Finally, learn to find and manipulate one’s own soul during meditation. Once one has learned to travel to the First Sphere, they may use the title “alchemist”, and are prepared for a lifelong journey of self-discovery.
>
> Aside from satiating one's spirit, alchemy has a great many practical applications. While healing the sick with potions is perhaps the best-known usage of the discipline, alchemy can be applied to harden and preserve natural materials like wood from decay for many hundreds of years past when it would normally rot. It can enable communication between Drehmari and animals. It can even make hardtack taste like a full Casain quail feast! I implore you, dear reader, take up the discipline today.
