> The Adventuring Merchant in New Drabyel.

Adventuring Merchants are special merchants, one of which can be found in each [official town/city](/World/Settlements/Official_Towns/) (with the exception of [[Rhaveloth]]). An Adventuring Merchant's stall or building is marked by red and orange wool awning. Each of them sells a map of the town's region, a map of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] that displays all official towns on the mainland, a bundle, a runic vessel (shulker box), and another special item that is unique to the merchant, and usually is associated with their area.

Every Adventuring Merchant has the following trades:

## Lore

Adventuring Merchants stand under the protection of [[Green Serpent]], the ancient merchants' guild that was once an extension of [[Avsohm]]'s government.

## Extras

Normally, Adventuring Merchants are immune to any sort of damage and cannot be turned into zombie villagers, but they can be killed by a player in Creative Mode or turned into a witch by a lightning strike. In this event, special merchant villagers can be re-summoned by using commands.

See [[FAQ#Can Custom Villagers Be Respawned?|this FAQ section]] for a full list of these commands.
