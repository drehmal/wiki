### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in an item frame in the center of [[Mohta]], containing a meditation on the nature of outer space in Drehmal, what lies beyond the Veil that prevents observation beyond the moons of the realm.

### Transcription:
> Whether we wanted it or not, the culture and religious beliefs of Lorahn'Kahl's people has been influenced to revolve around Drehmal's outer bodies: Lorahn, Loruhn, Lo'Dahr, and the Torahn.
>
> Yet, the question is - what lies beyond? The veil that surrounds this realm. What is it, exactly? What are the stars that dot the night sky, why do they only appear at night? Why is it black? What lies beneath the realm?
>
> These questions will unfortunately not be answered unless a deity were to tell us... and, in the thousands of years since the creation of the realm in the First Avihm, not a word has been spoken of it.
>
> So... what is it exactly? There's the myth of Tethlaen and falling off the face of the realm in early Av2, so where has he ended up? Searching deeper into this topic only brings more questions. Countless questions. There are reports of Avsohm being able to see beyond it, what the stars and night sky are, but papers and documents from that era are all but gone.

> We will learn one day.
