### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in the Alchemist Coven building in [[Maen's Domain]]. It discusses pain, one of the Primal Emotions, and its ability to generate Primal Energy.

### Transcription:
> Although all of the Primal Emotions are fundamental to the soul, Pain could be described as the most basic. Pain is induced in a soul via the presence of negative stimuli. Pain motivates a being to distance itself from said stimuli, usually as fast as possible. Like all Primal Emotions, Pain causes a release of Primal Energy. By torturing subjects, we are able to generate extract, and store large amounts of Primal Energy.
