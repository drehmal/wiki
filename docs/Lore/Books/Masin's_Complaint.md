## Transcription
> In the age of the Terminus, it’s hard to imagine why this old port is still under operation! The director said it was something to do with Khive interrupting the pathways of primal energy if they sit there for too long, or some gobbledygook like that. I don’t know the technological side of things, but I do know that the shuttle home can’t come soon enough. I’ve been stuck in this miserable hunk of rust for far too long. Laura and the kids must be worried sick. Now I’m a welder and a proud Avsohmic citizen, but I’m a mother too, and I miss home. I'm sure that the good Emperor wouldn’t condone his loyal subject being stranded away for over a year if he knew about my plight. Serpent knows I sent a complaint or two back, hoping he’d pick up on the other end. Even put in a good word for my pal Guhnr down at the inscription facility, but all to no avail.

> Well, when I finally do get out of here, I’m sure that the kids will love these rocks I found. Don’t see many quite like these back in Tharhan.
