Drehmal: Apotheosis is a Minecraft survival-adventure map that boasts a massive, rich open world with an original storyline, many custom gameplay features, expansive lore, and more! The most recent version of Drehmal is v2.2.1: Apotheosis, built for Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1.

Our wiki is a collaborative effort to document the wonders of Drehmal for new and experienced players alike, spearheaded entirely by highly invested community members. 

!!! note "This wiki is very much still a work in progress, with many pages still unfinished, unorganized, outdated, or yet to be written at all. If you'd like to help contribute to our ongoing expansion in any way (or just want to follow along with the process), then check out the #wiki-creation channel in the Discord, available if you've completed the map. Alternatively, you can inquire about the wiki on the Discord (we'll find you), or comment on any page on the website with a GitHub account."

## Spoilers, the Wiki, and You!
Drehmal is a fantastic experience, and while this wiki is here to help you navigate and learn more about it, we CANNOT stress enough that you should attempt to find things for yourself on this map! There are many huge moments in the map's story, incredible hidden areas, and progression-locked abilities that are cool to read about, but much more fun to discover on your own!

Drehmal is designed without the use of outside resources in mind, and can absolutely be completed that way! If this is your first playthrough (even if you've played an older version before but not 2.2), don't rob yourself of the wonderful time this map has to offer. Due to the nature of some aspects of the map, it is nearly impossible for this wiki to be comprehensive without being a significant spoiler risk for new players. Even the names of some pages and folders could be considered a spoiler!

As such, this wiki has been (and will continue to be) exhaustively tagged with spoilers. At the top of each page, look for any spoiler messages that look like this:

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

This message will typically be followed by another message or series of messages in the same format, which will tell you the point in the story that you are likely safe to read that page. Spoiler messages may also appear later in articles, if only part of an article is a spoiler.

!!! danger "Spoiler warnings typically appear in either this red text block..."

!!! warning "...or this yellow-orange one (which often denotes slightly less severe spoilers)."

If you find yourself still needing outside help but don't want to risk the spoilers present on this wiki, then the Discord is a fantastic alternative to directly ask questions to experienced and helpful community members.

## Navigating the Wiki
This wiki (like its subject matter) has a lot of content, but we're here to help you make sense of it!

At the top of your screen, you should see 6 main tabs besides the current one, which you can start at when navigating the wiki:

- Just want to browse a bit of everything? **[Overview](/Overview/)** provides a glossary of all tags on the wiki. <br>
- Looking for info on the many new items that Drehmal adds to the Minecraft experience? **[Items](/Items/)** is where you'll find all of the unique items that Drehmal has to offer. These range from [Legendary](/Items/Legendary_Items/) and [Mythical](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/) weapons—weapons with incredibly powerful stats, custom models, and custom abilities—to [[Relics]], off-hand items gained through the unique [[Devotion]] mechanic that boost player stats. <br>
- Interested in the deeper intricacies of the map's rich history? **[Lore](/Lore/)** is your one-stop shop for all things beyond the main story! Here, you can find a [comprehensive list of every lore book](/Lore/Books/), information on the [gods of the realm](/Lore/Higher_Beings/), pages describing [major historical events](/Lore/Historical_Events/), and more! <br>
- **[Misc](/Misc/)** is our spot for miscellaneous articles, those that just don't quite fit anywhere else. Have a look and see what oddities the map has to offer! <br>
- Just finished the story, or a part of it, and want a refresher on what exactly just happened? Stuck on a particular puzzle? **[Story and Features](/Story_and_Features/)** is where you can find pages related to the main story and core mechanics of Drehmal. This includes a [[Story Progression|summary of the story]], a list of all Drehmal's story-driving [holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/), a thorough description of the [[Devotion]] system, pages detailing the story beats, gameplay, and lore of the many [story locations](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/), and more! Just beware of spoilers... <br>
- Lost in the expanse of the continent, or just want to read a bit about interesting locations? **[World](/World/)** is where you'll find pages relating to the open world of Drehmal. Check out our [Drehmal Regions Overview](/World/Drehmal_Regions/), which contains a list of the world's regions and major POIs within those regions for a broad look at the map! Tracking your linked towers and visited towns? Take a look at the Interactive Map (WIP, not yet implemented)! Interested in reading more about the towns of Drehmal? Check out [Settlements](/World/Settlements/)!

Navigating through these tabs is the cleanest way to use this wiki, but there is also a built-in search function! Just be aware, this search bar will reveal **all** matches for a term, including matches for early-game terms on very late-game spoiler articles, so it is recommended that you stay away from that feature if you are at all concerned about spoilers.
