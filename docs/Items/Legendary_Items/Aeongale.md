**Aeongale** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The legendary leggings of [[Oriann|Dragonrider Oriann]], the fabled [[Tehrmari]] who was extremely close to [[Rihelma]], Aeongale is a piece of armor that has the unique ability to increase the wearer's perception, making enemies and projectiles move slightly slower.

| **Lore**                      | Prior to the Divine Schism, La'Tehrmari were largely ascended because of their friendship with Aspects. Their mortal Ro'Tehrmari children were not as favored. But there was one notable exception: Dragonrider Oriann, the only being ever to understand Rihelma. The Star-Rise Drake crafted this armor for her beloved, and laid it in a crystalline tomb after Oriann's natural death. |

## Gameplay
Aeongale is an NBT-modified pair of netherite leggings, inheriting that base durability.

Aeongale is a relatively strong piece of armor, with the same armor (+6) as vanilla netherite leggings, but a smaller armor toughness (+1 vs. +3) boost than the vanilla variant. It also takes away a very significant 5 hearts, and makes the player move faster.

Aeongale's primary feature is its special ability, Guided by Fate. This ability gives a slowness effect to any hostile entities within a roughly 7 block radius, and also slows down projectiles such as arrows fired at the player, with special blue particles swirling around the projectile indicating that it has been affected by Aeongale. This ability is only active if the player is at full HP.

## How to Obtain
Aeongale is located at the end of the [[Augural Tangle]], an expansive cavern underneath the Star-Rise full of crystals connected to [[Rihelma]]'s ability to receive prophecies.

For a more extensive guide on the Augural Tangle itself, see its article.

Aeongale is located at the end of the dungeon, after all of the lights have been activated, with a massive door opening into a crystalline path that leads to a dome structure. Within this dome structure, a trapped chest containing Aeongale is found, alongside a grave, presumably belonging to [[Oriann]].

## Lore
Aeongale was created by Rihelma for Dragonrider [[Oriann]], a [[Tehrmari#Ro'Tehrmari|Ro'Tehrmari]] who became a legendary figure for her closeness to the Aspect of Sky. Oriann likely wore this very pair of pants into battle with Rihelma in the [[Divine Schism]], and it is very likely that the structure where they are found is the same structure that is home to Oriann's remains.
