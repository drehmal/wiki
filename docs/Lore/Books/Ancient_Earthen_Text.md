## Transcription
> We, the devout, mine the **taihryte**, sacred to Taihgel, deep under this town, and **bury our desires within its ancient, formless red marbled stone, which burns within and burns without, if ignited, shall burn forever**, may our offerings be incorporated into the virgin stone, the first stone, and may the land walk again.
