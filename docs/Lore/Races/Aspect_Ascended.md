# Aspect-Ascended

Individual [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) are capable of ascending Drehmari to [[Tehrmari]] status, but they also appear to be able to make them into more specific forms. These **Aspect-Ascended** sub-races are sometimes mentioned in the map, but do not actually appear anywhere.

## Kohmari

The most prominent outright mention of these races is in [[Xor'Huul]], of the Kohmari: ascended of the Stone Aspect [[Koh]]. The priests of Xor'Huul, who worshipped this Aspect, attempted a ritual to turn themselves into Kohmari to grow closer to the Aspect, but brought a plague upon themselves that destroyed their settlement.

The [[Priest's Diary]] describes Kohmari as "a people of stone scales and gemstone eyes", reflecting Koh's domain closely.

## Other References

**Laimari**, the ascended of [[Lai|Brightwyrm Lai]], are referenced once in [[Eta's Journal]] as having had a trick for lighting fires in cold weather.
