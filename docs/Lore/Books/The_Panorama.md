This book can be found on a lectern on a floating island in the central portion of [[Rihelma's Domain]]. Within, a [[Tehrmari]] visits their first spouse for the first time in years, having effectively lived many other lives since the last time they met, and learns that she has been painting the domain daily since that time, becoming increasingly adept at capturing the landscape in stunning detail. Enamored with her attention to detail, patience, and commitment, the author decides to remain with her for the rest of their lives.

## Transcription
> Yesterday, I paid a visit to my first spouse for the first time in ages. We ate, and then went to the upstairs studio. To my shock, she really did stick to it, painting the same vista of Rihelmaâ€™s Domain every year. For a long time, I had thought Esa was foolish for it. But looking at the movements of the islands and the drying of the sea over time, realization washed over me. As the years went on, her images became sharper and clearer. The details became more finely honed, and the texture of the sky was indistinguishable from reality. When at last we came to her most recent painting, I could no longer stop tears from rolling down my face. How many centuries had I spent away? While I was learning how to make swords and ceramics and theorizing the best government possible for Drehmari with all the other bored academics, Esa was painting every day. While I married over forty other people before tiring and heading for the door again, she remained truly devoted. It was clear to me then how vast a temporal gulf there was between the two of us. I had lived as a mortal, trying everything under the Torahn but never finding happiness. Always, I needed more and different. But Esa was like Rihelma herself on her lofty perch. Yesterday, I fell into her orbit and knew that I never wanted to leave again.

> So from now on, I never shall. I want to be a part of her panorama.
