# v2.1: TIMEBREAK

![[2.1_map.png]]
> The map of Drehmal as it appeared in v2.1. The large-scale terrain is nearly identical to the current version in 2.2, with the exception of the northeastern [[Frozen Bite]] and [[Highfall Tundra]] regions, which were reworked completely in 2.2.

**Drehmal v2.1: TIMEBREAK** was the first update to Drehmal v2, released on November 21, 2020 for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16.5. 

The 2.1 update did not expand on the terrain of v2.0, but did add and refine multiple elements of the experience. Being the official and most recent version of the map for almost three years, it is also the most downloaded and most widely played version of Drehmal.

## New Content

2.1 was the first version to feature additional developers beyond co-creators Keeko and Rift, also fielding contributions from HotElbows on custom weapon abilities. It made some tweaks to the main story locations, reworked the fast travel towers, added new [legendaries](/Items/Legendary_Items/), and added abilities to the existing [Mythical Weapons](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/). 

The main story was also reworked in v2.1, adding [[Sal'Mevir]] at 25% completion as well as changing the order of some other story events. The [[Emperor's Estate]] dungeon was also added to the island of [[Sahd]] in this update.
