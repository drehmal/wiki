## Transcription
> Uncle Ehzar got me a new dolly! I told him I was a big girl, and too old for dolls... but I really like her. She sleeps by my bed and keep me company! It's nice to have a friend. Whenever I get sad and start to cry, I reach over and hold her... I just wish the crying would stop when I stopped.
