## Transcription
> We've lost contact with High Command. In fact, we've lost contact with every other research facility. Sal'Mevir won't even respond to our pings. Hopefully this is just a blip, some worker in the primary comms station probably just flipped a switch and brought the whole network down. Now they're getting yelled at by their superior while everyone else at the facility scrambles to get everything back online.

> But I know that's not the case. Something very, very bad has happened and I'm terrified. We're scheduled to run what should be the final ArkAngel activation in less than an hour. Just need to stay focused on that, keep morale up here. Soon we'll all be back outside, experiencing the warmth of the sun and the embrace of our loved ones. Jihv will be breathing fresh air, Gyl will see his children. I'll get to see my husband. Olvan, dearest, I may not see you again. That is my greatest regret.
