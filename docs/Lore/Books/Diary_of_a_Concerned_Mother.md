 

This book can be found on a lectern in northeastern [[Av'Sal]], written by a concerned woman whose family is squatting in the ruins of the former Avsohmic capital, fearing that the [[Mihkmari]] will find them.

> Those damn Mihkmari are spreading again. We've been avoiding the old guildhouse for a while, but nowadays we can't even scavenge in the industrial zone to the west without running into a patrol. And going to the central island would be tantamount to suicide at this point. It's simply swarming with the gray-skinned freaks. I told my husband we should move out ages ago, but he said the loot was too good to pass up. Lotta good a bunch of broken tech will do us when those uncivilized barbarians start battering down our doors. Virtuo, be with us, I beg of you.
