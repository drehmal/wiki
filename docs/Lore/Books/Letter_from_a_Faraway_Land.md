> I hope you’re well. There’s not long to wait now- we are finally about ready to embark across the Gulf of Drehmal and home. We managed to secure quite a haul- Duspian silks will fetch a fine price in Athrah. My heart aches every day when thinking of you, my love. I’m sure you’re nearly finished with your novel. And Zez must have eight years by now! It might be a little late to tell you this now, little man, but I hope you had a wonderful birthday, and that you aren’t giving your father too much of a hard time. But you can give him a little bit of a hard time. Grab his leg when he’s leaving the outhouse or something like that, I’m sure he’ll love that! (Won’t you, my adorable, dashing bookbrain?)

> We leave tonight! The goods are stowed and the larder is full. Not a cloud in the sky, so the Sailor's Moon will be a wonderful guide. As I look up at Lo’Dahr’s brilliant golden light, all I can think about is the light shining through that round front window. I can’t wait to see our house again, and I can’t wait to see you both.
