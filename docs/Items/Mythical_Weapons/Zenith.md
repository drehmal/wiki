**Zenith** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Located in the [[Foundry]], Zenith is a hybrid energy saber/laser gun, forged using the power of [[Primal Energy]] by the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]]. The weapon is obtained by clearing the entirety of the combat challenge in the Foundry's arena.

It is said that all matter and energy is derived from it. Distilling such a material into its rawest form for use in combat is exactly the reason why Avsohm was dealt such a harrowing fate. |

## Gameplay
Like some other Drehmal items with unique mechanics, Zenith is actually a warped fungus on a stick, heavily modified using NBT tags.

Zenith allows for a hybrid melee/ranged build, using its relatively weak but quick melee attacks to passively generate charges for its stronger ranged attack. Zenith's ranged attack fires out multiple projectiles in a ring (akin to a shotgun blast), dealing up to 30 damage if all projectiles hit the target.

Because of Zenith's unique mechanics, it cannot support enchantments.

??? warning "Late-Game Spoilers: Upgrades"
    Like the other Mythicals, Zenith can be upgraded with one of each Fervor Stone at the Soletta, increasing its health, cooldown, and movement speed bonuses. A fully upgraded Zenith grants the player +8 Max Health (+4 Hearts) and +0.01 Movement Speed. Since Zenith does not have a traditional ability cooldown time, it instead gains a 25% boost to charges gained from melee damage when upgraded with a Stone of Agony.

## How to Obtain
Zenith is obtained quite simply, by clearing all 6 waves of the Arena at the [[Foundry]]. The Foundry is located in the small strip of land near the western coast, between the northern extent of the [[Anyr'Nogur]] desert and the southern edge of [[Mt. Ebonfire]]. 

Inside the Foundry is an arena, in which the player will face 6 waves of strong enemies, including a miniboss in the final wave. After the player has defeated the final wave, a door will open in the east side of the room, leading down a staircase to a room containing the weapon.

## Lore
There seems to be very little lore surrounding Zenith beyond its own item description, which references the [[Fall of Avsohm]]. It is well-known that Avsohm's use of [[Primal Energy]] was the source of their power over the realm, as well as their ultimate doom, but outside of the [[Mythbreaker]], this seems to be the second strongest weapon that Avsohm created.
