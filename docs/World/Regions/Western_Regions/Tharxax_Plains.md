*This region can hardly be called plains with its high cliffs and vast plateaus. These geographical difficulties have made it an incredibly difficult region to conquer throughout history, leaving it the only area in the far west to be currently unconquered by Maelihs at the time (despite him having taken full control of the West previously). Over time, it’s people have had to adapt to being so close to Mael’s sanctum, and as such have created a strong, militaristic society. At the moment, its southern, flatter regions are controlled by Mael while the northern regions remain unoccupied.*
