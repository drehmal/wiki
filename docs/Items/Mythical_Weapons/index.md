# Mythical Weapons

Mythical weapons are regarded as the strongest weapons in the game. They have their own 3D models, item descriptons, crafting recipes (only unlocked by its advancement after being obtained by a player for the first time), stat modifiers and special abilities that are usually alternate, more powerful attacks. Mythical weapons are also unbreakable. Each weapon has its own special challenge that the player must complete to obtain it.

# List

There are 9 mythical weapons in the game (including Inert Mythbreaker). 8 are found on Drehmal, and 1 on Lo'Dahr. Here is a list of every mythical weapon:

| **Ability**                      | **True Catastrophe**: Hold crouch and then jump to channel the power of the Skullbeasts (switching weapons at any point during the charge will cancel the ability), releasing untold ruin upon foes.

| **Lore**                         | No mortal has ever come close to slaying a Skullbeast, meaning the one deployed in the Desolation has long since died of natural causes. Ossein happened upon its remains, and became fanatically obsessed. They carved numerous weapons of immense strength from the calamitous skeleton, with these claws being the most powerful. |
| **Obtain**                       | Defeat [[Skull Disciple Ossein]] in the epicenter [[Mael's Desolation]]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Lore**                       | Many centuries ago, Sahd was a cruel, war-torn land where the grass was stained with blood.

??? warning "Quest Guide"
    **Suggested Items:** Potions of Night Vision, Food, Weapons, General Adventuring Items

    Enter the Palace Staff Quarters in the Tidal Palace in [[Firteid]], and continue until the sign that says DANGER! Malfunctioning elevator and chasm. Break through and drop down the chasm, ladders and/or water bucket suggested. At the bottom is a nearly pitch black tunnel filled with monsters, fight through and follow it to the end - a room with a chest. Inside this chest will be the Compass of Nihility, which points north from this spot.

    If you have the tower, teleport to The [[Frozen Bite]], if not, follow the compass from whichever tower you have that is most north east on your map. The compass leads to an abandoned house with a few mobs and spawners. Search the house thoroughly for lore books, other unique items, and specifically a chest with [[Nihilist's Notes]]. Make sure to take a copy, and head to Mt. Yavhlix as mentioned in the notes.

    If you've been to the doors before, the location the notes refers to is slightly south west of the doors, and marked with a stone pillar with a sea lantern on top. Throw a copy of the Nihilist's Notes onto the black concrete which opens a hole. Jump down and you will be met with a dark labyrinth. You can mine through some walls, but the labyrinth is solvable and leads to a chest with Oblivion.

## Ascendance

| **Lore**                           | The ultimate goal of the Tri-Moon Theocracy was to form a strong connection with the moon of Lo'Dahr, home of the deities. This blade was the crux of that plan and can channel the power of the divine moon itself. |
| **Obtain**                         | Solve the riddle in the [[Moonlight Sanctum]] which is hidden somewhere in [[Lorahn'Kahl]]                                                                                                                           |

??? warning "Dungeon Guide"
    **Suggested Items:** Armor, Shield, Ranged Weapon, Building Blocks, Bed to set respawn, Food for healing

    Once you enter the [[Moonlight Sanctum]] you will be inflicted with mining fatigue. Find a tower with a door and button, enter, and kill the Undead Theocracy Archers. Once the room is clear, look below at the floor and shoot through the holes to kill the Elder Guardian. Repeat for the remaining 2 towers, 3 in total. Once the Elder Guardians are dead, head to the bridge and press the button:

    _[Ascendant Voice] Elders slain. Magic ward lifted._

    Before you head down the bridge, there is a trapped chest in the center of the cave. You can now break through and retrieve the paper named _Ancient Theocracy Rites_.

    Continue down the bridge and break the glass to continue into the next room. You will be met with a sign that says THE FIRST OF EACH RITE IS THE WAY TO THE LIGHT. Refer to the _Ancient Theocracy Rites_ and the first letter of each line. Line up the arrows to match and the puzzle is solved.
