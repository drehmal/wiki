 

This book can be found on a lectern within the ruins of [[Eloa]]. A letter written from sibling to sibling, it informs Serosin, the sister living in Eloa, of her father's death. The letter states that he was found disheveled and emaciated in the middle of the road, and refused to eat anything for fear of poison, dying of starvation back home at [[Mossfield]]. This is likely connected to the [[Skeveraan Laboratory]].

> Dear Serosin,
>
> This is Enirick. Please make sure you are seated. I love you very much. This letter is difficult for me to write, and it will be even harder to read.
>
> I’m writing this to tell you about Dad. He passed away yesterday (Maelmaklah 12, I am not sure what day this letter will reach you). It came as a great shock to all of us. Three weeks ago, he left town to bring supplies to the hamlet of Helmshire to the west, who lost a lot of people in mysterious circumstances recently. When he didn’t come back, we started worrying. A woodsman finally found him half a week ago laying in the middle of the road home, hair gone completely white, and thin as a reed.
>
> He assured us he was fine, but  it was clear that something was very wrong. He looked so tired, and there were scratch marks on his face. He kept insisting that there was poison in the food and refusing to eat. It was completely illogical. We still grow our own crops, and the chickens haven’t gone anywhere. We begged and cried and pleaded, and even tried to force-feed him, but his jaw was like a steel trap. Days and days went by. There was nothing even the doctor could do. In the end, Sis, he chose to starve.
>
> I’m so sorry to have to be the one to deliver this news, but you need to come back to Mossfield for the funeral. We won't have it without you. Please be safe on the road. Maybe try to go in a caravan. Absolutely do NOT come alone.
>
> I love you so much, and I am so, so sorry,

> Enirick
