## Transcription
> Today is the Day of Patronage! Every week, traders from across the land visit Naharja to engage in commerce, and over time, us Naharjans have turned it into a celebration. Fireworks are set off, live music is played throughout the city, and all the shops lower prices in the name of almsgiving.
>
> I plan to first visit the Noodle Shop in the Night Lights District- I need to try the Lover's Stew. Then I'll stop by the potion shop and pick up a new banner for the living room. Finally, I'll pick up some meat at Cornercopia! Quite the busy itinerary, but one befitting a day of such import!
