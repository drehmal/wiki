**The Frostfang** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

A legendary sword that was pivotal in the [[Frostfang Catastrophe|single greatest ecological event]] in the realm's history, the Frostfang is found in southern [[Faehrcyle]], where it was originally used to create the blizzard that permanently altered the climate of several northern regions.

| **Lore**                      | When the Avsohmic Empire first began their Faehrcyle mining operation, the Frostfang Tribes were displeased. Tensions grew and culminated in Homli Tahsgan, ruler of the tribes, freezing over the entire north in what became known as the Frostfang Catastrophe. Nowadays, the Tribe has mostly disbanded, spreading to nearby regions to separate themselves from it. |

## Gameplay
The Frostfang is an NBT-modified diamond sword, retaining the base durability of vanilla diamond swords.

The Frostfang leans into a faster playstyle, adding +0.02 Movement Speed and having a relatively high attack speed of 2.2, at the cost of 6 Max Health (-3 Hearts). Its Bane of Arthropods IV enchantment can be useful situationally, but the majority of enemies in Drehmal are not affected by this ability.

The weapon's ability, Tempest's Grasp, causes hostile mobs to be afflicted with Slowness for a couple seconds when hit with the weapon for the first time. This is indicated by blue particles around the mob.

## How to Obtain
The Frostfang is located at the [[Grave of Frost]], the final resting place of Faehrcylian leader [[Homli Tahsgan]]. This structure is located in southwestern [[Faehrcyle]], heavily guarded by Strays named "Frostfang Gravewatcher." The trapped chest that holds the sword is at the center of this structure's pit, the actual grave of Homli himself.

The Frostfang was the weapon wielded by [[Homli Tahsgan]] during the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], with the incredibly powerful arcanist unlocking the weapon's fullest potential. 

It is revealed by a series of tablets in [[Ytaj]], presumably in what was once the room of [[Palaesida]], that Homli's possession of the Frostfang was no accident. The [[Divine Schism]], an event that runs parallel in many ways to the Catastrophe, was begun by a scheme between the then-young [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) [[Palaesida]], [[Loeleyhn]], and [[Rihalae]]. The latter two created a distraction while Palaesida stole the Frostfang from its forge, the Soletta, in Ytaj. He then gifted the blade to Homli Tahsgan, and shortly thereafter, it was used to create the blizzard that would eternally freeze the North. Ultimately, this scheme resulted in the expansion of Loeleyhn's domain (her being the Aspect of Snow), but caused [[Noha]] to take her own life after losing Faehrcyle, ultimately kicking off the first and only war between the Aspects.
