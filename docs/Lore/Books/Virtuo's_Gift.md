## Transcription
> There are many reasons to thank the Lady Virtuo. Of course, as a fragment of the Primal Tree, she deserves the same respect Tehrmari give all deities. But a more subtle gift is this: the Orderflame. Fire is a powerful tool - blessed be Lailoehn - but its chaotic nature was unfit for Ytaj. Virtuo, sensing this, gifted us her Orderflame: a form of fire that lacks the chaotic nature of its kin. Voynahla, in particular, took a liking to it, and uses it extensively. We Tehrmari use it in the many braziers surrounding Ytaj, as a token of thanks.
