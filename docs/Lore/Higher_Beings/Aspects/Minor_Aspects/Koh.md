## Description

![[koh_ref.png]]
> Koh's official 2.2 reference image.

Koh takes the form of a long, gray worm/serpentine dragon. This is depicted in the map once, as a simple white worm made of calcite and diorite. This statue is found on the [[Island of Dawn]], just to the northeast of [[Star-Rise Bastion]].

Koh's passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] reads:

> Wise Worm Koh, Aspect of Stone
> ***
> A reclusive Aspect, responsible for tunnels and caverns.

> The statue of Koh on the Island of Dawn.

Koh is said to be reclusive, but very wise. They are credited with having created the world's tunnels and caves.

### Color/Build Scheme

Koh's colors include black and different shades of gray, with purple accents. All of the default types of stone are associated with Koh, including stone, (deep)slate, andesite, diorite, granite, Taihryte, calcite, and basalt. Additionally, builds referencing Koh often make use of Drehmal's custom-textured Amethyst Tile blocks and vanilla amethyst blocks.

## In-Map References

Koh plays a significant role in the lore of the Islands of [[Island of Dusk|Dusk]] and [[Island of Dawn|Dawn]], and is also mentioned in [[Wokonori]].

As part of the trio of earth-related Aspects (alongside [[Taihgel]] and [[Nahyn]]), Koh was worshipped by the people of Wokonori when they lived in late Av1/early Av2. This is asserted by the [[Artifacts#Stoneshaper|Stoneshaper]] artifact.

Koh was also worshipped exclusively by some of the people who lived on the twin Islands of Dusk and Dawn to the far northwest. The Xorhai, who would go on to found the underground city of [[Xor'Huul]], worshipped Koh and attempted to commune directly with the Aspect of Stone.

Koh's [[Aspect Ascended]] race is the only one extensively mentioned in version 2.2, as the priests of Xor'Huul turned themselves into monsters and died after attempting to become Kohmari, said to have stone scales and gemstone eyes. The [[Coven of Koh]], a separate settlement on the Island of Dusk, still survives to this day.

Koh is mentioned by Maelihs as being a great teacher in his attempts to meditate and grow more introspective.
