Found in the [[Exodus Vault]], this holotext expresses concern from [[Kahmas Tuhs]] over the [[Mythbreaker]] schematics' origins, presumably having been created by a higher intelligence, and references something called the "Resonant Eye" inside [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

> This projection is a representation of the data gathered from the **anomaly** by the **Resonant Eye** within **Yavhlix**, and the origin of Lord Anyr’s mania. It is from this data that we ascertained the shape of a spear, the shape of what would become **Mythbreaker**. To receive such clear data, something so clearly manufactured by an intelligence from what one could assume is a natural phenomena… It makes me uneasy.
