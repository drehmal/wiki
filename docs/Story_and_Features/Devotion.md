# Devotion

![[drehmal_shrine.png]]
> Drehmal's devotion altar at [[Drehua Temple]].

Devotion is a mechanic unique to Drehmal that allows players to earn powerful offhand items called "[[Relics|relics]]", as well as other rewards, by depositing specific items at altars dedicated to different gods, scattered throughout the world. Each of the eight [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects) and three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities) has their own altar in a different location on the map.

There is a set of items that each Aspect/Deity accepts as offerings, each one having one of three different values. Every offering increases the player's "devotion" to the Aspect/Deity that the altar is dedicated to.

The player receives (devotion-specific) experience points for every offering. Every 100 exp. worth of offerings increases the player's devotion level by one, and they will be gifted certain items depending on the level. Among these rewards are 4 different levels (separate items) of a relic, each level scaling the magnitude of its effects. The first level of the relic is the first reward, and the fourth one is the final reward. 

Some of the offerings accepted by an Aspect/Deity can be found laying in invisible item frames in the area surrounding their altar. In the case of the Deities, offerings can also be found in invisible item frames at statues of them throughout their respective domains. Nearby every altar is a book placed in an item frame that hints at additional items that are valued by them.

## Devotion Hints

Near every Aspect's devotion altar is a book (a book with its writing in the item description; not a book and quill or written book) that gives clues to help the player to find accepted gifts for that shrine. 

Low-level (Liked) devotion offerings can be found scattered around devotion shrines themselves, inside of invisible item frames. However, in order to discover the higher-value offerings in-game, players must either guess based off of the god's theme, or discover accepted items through the hints provided in devotion books. Each devotion book hints at a unique mechanic, typically referencing specific structures throughout one or more regions that contain accepted items, left as offerings to that specific god. Hints are also included in the "Offerings" section for their respective Deity or Aspect below. They do not include the accepted music discs for each god.

## Offerings

Different items can increase devotion to an Aspect or Deity at three levels: a small, medium, or large gain. Within the game's files, these are referred to as "Liked," "Loved," and "Adored" gifts, respectively. At intervals of 100 XP, players will earn a new devotion level with the shrine's deity or aspect, and receive a new reward. All shrines have 10 devotion levels, with the exception of Rihelma, who has 13.

**Liked Gift Message:**
> "Your offering fills the room with a pleasing aura. Your devotion to (NAME) has deepened slightly."

**Loved Gift Message:**
> "Your offering fills the room with bliss. Your devotion to (NAME) has deepened."

**Adored Gift Message:**
> "Your offering fills the room with overwhelming joy. Your devotion to (NAME) has deepened greatly."

The amount of devotion XP gained per offering varies with each god, as they each award a different amount of points for each offering tier. This is likely to account for the rarity of their respective offerings. Liked offerings typically give single-digit points, while top-tier offerings usually give about 40-50 points each. A table of offering values can be found below.

| **Aspect/Deity** | **Liked** | **Loved** | **Adored** |
|:----------------:|:---------:|:---------:|:----------:|
| [[Drehmal]]      | 4 | 20 | 40 |
| [[Virtuo]]       | 5 | 18 | 50 |
| [[Maelihs]]      | 10 | 34 | 100 |

> Attention, spectators. The Speakers of the Sepulchral Altar would like to thank you for attending todayâ€™s Ascension. On behalf of the Burnt Generals, we ask that you leave offerings at the many other **statues of Maelihs throughout His domain** instead of coming to the sanctum after the ritual. Thank you.

### Khive Offerings

Khive's devotion hint book reads as follows:

I don't see so much as a **single rune above ground** in this sorry mess! This is the last straw. I'm out of here, and I'm never taking another job at Ancehl Castle from that slimy coot!

Khive's devotion hints are items found inside of brewing stands, in the buried ruins beneath Ihted, his devotion site.

They're either a fellow saltblood who knows to place an offering to Dahr **on the prow of their ship**, or they're a living corpse who needs every bit of help they can get from a priest like me. Either way, it's a good time.

Hints for Dahr's devotion are found in item frames on the very front of large ships throughout the realm, docked in several locations around the southern and eastern coasts of the continent.

To that end, I told my friends to find the best possible **recipe**. Now, itâ€™s time to go across Akhlo'Rohma and **visit their stills**. I am sure that their ingredients will please Her!

Hints for Vayniklah's devotion items are found inside large kegs of mead, scattered throughout [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. Items inside of these kegs, at the bottom of the water in an item frame, are high-level offerings to the Aspect of Life. All of these kegs are marked with a sign that references the item inside, and all share the exact same build pattern.

### Voynahla Offerings

Voynahla's devotion hint book reads as follows: 

> Be warned: you may be unable to wield the knife yourself. For this reason, you must always have a funereal plan wherever you go. Be **buried** at once **beneath Death's head with items** which will appease Voynahla's spirit. If you show no fear, you may yet be granted mercy.

Hints for this Aspect are found throughout the entire continent, buried in chests beneath stone skulls near six different graveyards.

??? info "Hint Locations"
    Voynahla skulls are found at: the [[Perishing Well]], the graveyard in [[Athrah]], the southern face of the hill that [[Dusps]] sits on, the graveyard containing the [[Artifacts#Totem of Dying|Totem of Dying]] near the ruins of [[Azaim]], the outside of [[Mossfield]], and just outside the wall of the [[Firteid]] graveyard.

### Lai Offerings

Lai's devotion hint book reads as follows:

> Kind Traveler,
>
> Though this sacred flame once burned longer and brighter than any other, it has sadly been extinguished.
>
> But there are still **many other sacred flames burning in Merijool**. If you find one, leave an offering to Lai **beneath**.
>
> Our faith is what stops this land from freezing!
>
> Signed, Pilgrim of the South

Throughout western Merijool, five locations of sacred, chromatic flames can be found, with accepted Lai devotion items found in item frames directly beneath the stained glass "flame". 

??? info "Hint Locations"
    The five hint locations for Lai are: on top of the Shrine of Eternal Flame, where there is currently no flame but where there would have been once; about 130 blocks northeast of the Shrine, along the delta; approximately 200 blocks due west of the Shrine, in [[Okeke]] beneath the sacred flame atop a building, and in the center of a high pond between Okeke and the Shrine.

### Loe Offerings

> We have grown impatient as of late. Another new pit of **strange soft snow** has opened up around our Arch-Ducal Castle! Despite throwing all of those things **into the pits** like the Loe Follower said!
>
> Though new pits are showing up less, we wish they would just stop for good!

This establishes that Loe's devotion items are found at the bottom of pits of strange, soft snowâ€”powder snowâ€”around the area.

??? info "Hint Locations"
    There are at least four such pits of powder snow, which have high-level Loe devotion offerings at their bottoms. One pit is located just south of the Crystalline Colonnade, with a warning sign.
