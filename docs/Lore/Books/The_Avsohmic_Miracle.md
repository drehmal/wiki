## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Old Insohmic Library]]. It discusses the manner through which Avsohm was able to rise to such great power so quickly through an empirical lens, arguing that multiple alchemical fields underwent incredibly rapid revolutions, paving the way for Avsohmic domination, rather than divine intervention being the cause behind the empire's power.

## Transcription
> In recent years, historians and academics have come to fall prey to the myth of the "Avsohmic Miracle", a near mythological event that heralded the transformation of the Chosen Kingdom into the powerful and realm-spanning Avsohmic Empire. Many believe this to be the work of Deities, or ascribe other mystical reasonings to it. I propose that said "miracle" was an entirely material and empirical occurrence. Avsohm had simultaneous upheavals in the fields of Alchemy, Runicism, and Industrialism - and these revolutions set the stage for Avsohmic world domination.
>
> First, let us discuss the Avsohmic Alchemical Revolution. Some scholars of Alchemy actually refer to this as the Second Alchemical Revolution, the period of time after the foundation of the Doctrine of Spheres up until the first recorded instance of Necromancy in Av2.
>
> For the sake of clarity, I will only discuss the Avsohmic Alchemical Revolution beyond this point. It comprised two branches: a deeper understanding of Hermetic Alchemy, and the development of the school of Bionic Alchemy. Avsohm's grasp on the nature of reality allowed for much more potent brews and potions than what previous practitioners were able to achieve, with some even claiming that Avsohm developed super soldiers out of a more potent form of Khivesbrew. The second branch also dealt with upgrading of the Drehmari body, and was built off previous work done by obscure Alchemical sects of the Black Jungle. It involved modifying the body with artificial or mechanical implants, often taking advantage of Avsohm's infamous talent of runic miniaturization.
>
> Runic miniaturization is just one example of how Avsohm advanced the field of Runicism. Avsohm inscribed tiny spheres of Rehntite (a material widely regarded to have the highest levels of innate potentia ever discovered) with even tinier runes. This allowed the inscription of unfathomable numbers of runes onto a single Rehntite core. Using these cores, Avsohm could perform seemingly impossible feats and create awe-inspiring feats of technology. Contemporary Avsohmic sources mention the existence of devices that could transmit sound, matter, and energy across the realm instantaneously. Sadly, the exact mechanisms by which the Avsohmic Empire did this have been lost to time, as has the source of their seemingly limitless Rehntite.
>
> However, not all secrets of Avsohmic industrialism have been lost. Two primary sources of industry are known to scholars: Av'sal and the Foundry. Av'sal, as the capital of Avsohm, was primary tasked with production of consumer goods, but did have facilities for the production of many autonomous exploration drones. The Foundry was the beating heart of Avsohm's military, producing most of the weapons and vehicles the Avsohmic empire used to dominate the realm.
>
> But it could never last. Right at the peak of Avsohmic innovation, disaster struck. Hundreds of high-ranking government and military officials, as well as thousands of infrastructural staff, disappeared over night. Lesser historians describe this event as the hubris of Avsohm leading to their downfall, assigning mystical import to the process. I admit, I do not understand what exactly caused this tragedy, but I hold firm that it was nothing more than a result of empirical reality.
