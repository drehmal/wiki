## Geography

This region is located in the North-west, and is mainly known for its autumnal forests. There are several parts of it that are inhibited by giant mushrooms. A river runs from the lake that Okeke borders, separating East Merijool and West Merijool, draining into the ocean down the middle of the region. In the north-eastern part of Merijool stands [[Mt. Mekta|Mount Mekta]], the third largest mountain in Drehmal.

Regions bordering Merijool include:

- [[Casai]]
- [[Gulf of Drehmal]]

## Notable Locations

- The village of [[Okeke]]
- The great wall of [[Maerhn'Vhos]]
- [[Mt. Mekta]]

> The Merijool Peninsula was once a lush jungle, but with the Frostfang Catastrophe of Av2 1646, climate change rapidly cooled the area and turned it to an autumnal forest. Throughout history, the people of Merijool have suffered internal conflicts and civil wars because of differing Aspect religions (Lai, The Brightwyrm in the west and Glacial Elder Loe in the east). Only recently have they overcome their religious differences to form together under a single, atheist society. There was also a short period of their history where they worshipped Maelihs.

## History

### Early Days



In the early days after the deity war, Merijool was inhabited by the Merian tribes. At some point between Av2 1000 and Av2 1412, the tribes joined together, and created a United Tribal Merijool. 

### Religious Differences

In the West, the Brightwyrm Lai, Aspect of Warmth was worshipped (reasons for this could include a warmer climate, flatter landscape, a seemingly volcanic north based on its many fissures (plus its proximity to the Silveht island volcano), and/or the location of the important West Merijoolan city of Okeke, in the warmer south). In the East, the Glacial Elder Loe, Aspect of Cold was worshipped (reasons for this could include a colder climate, the more mountainous landscape of the East, and/or the glaciers that cover the north on Mt. Mekta, on the lower slopes of which an important East Merijoolan city, Kamt, was built.)

### Dual Kingdoms Period

In Av2 1412, Merijool split into two Kingdoms, West and East, due to these religious differences. They went to war for centuries, with neither coming out on top. West Merijool had a rivalry with the Casian Empire, eventually winning full control over the plains between the two in the Zephyr War of Av2 1445. West Merijool also attempted to best the Tharhan Empire in the Av2 1500s. They failed miserably, and were not even able to approach the Western Wall, Maehrn’Vhos. While Merijool was fighting their battles, the Avsohmic Empire was growing in power, eventually posing a significant threat to Merijool. In response to this, the warring West and East were forced to join together in a sort of defense pact to try and resist Avsohm.

### Under Avsohm

Despite their forced unification, Merijool surrendered after Avsohm put some pressure on them. (Relatively small amount compared to other Avsohmic campaigns). The Merijool peninsula was now United under the Avsohmic flag, along with their rival neighbors of Casai and Tharhan. Merijool prospered under Avsohm, even though there was internal dissent against the external Avsohmic rule. However, this prosperity was severely impacted by the Frostfang Catastrophe of  Av2 1646.

### Post-Frostfang

The catastrophe completely changed Merijool’s ecosystem. The peninsula transitioned from a lush rainforest to a autumnal forest. Merijoolan culture was heavily damaged also, as the people now had to adapt to a much colder climate. This catastrophe increased internal strife in a couple ways. Firstly, as the catastrophe was largely viewed as Avsohm’s fault, the Merijoolans became even more resistant to Avsohm’s rule. Secondly, the catastrophe likely increased worship of the aspect Loe in the East, due to its proximity to the epicenter of the Frostfang Catastrophe in Faercyle, while in the West, it likely increased the worship of Lai as a sort of light in a dark time. This would lead to Merijool becoming a war centered society once again.

### Maelihs’ Occupation

When Avsohm fell and Maelihs overtook Western Drehmal, his war culture was praised in Merijool. This led to him gaining control of the peninsula without a fight. During its occupation by Maelihs, Neo-Maelmarism grew as a dominant religion within Merijool.

### Insohm to Modern Times

Not much is known about Merijool after this time period, but at some point in the Third Avihm the Order of Insohm fought against Maelihs, and took back control of Merijool. The people of Merijool finally put aside their religious differences, and joined together in a single athiest society. Currently they are United, with the seat of power being in Okeke.
