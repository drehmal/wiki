# Highfall Tundra

![[HF_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

Highfall Tundra is a cold region in northeastern [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Despite its name, it is only partially tundra, also having plains and sparse woods. It is named after the city of [[Highfall]], the region's main point of interest.

## Geography

Highfall Tundra is situated on Drehmal's east coast. It borders the [[Frozen Bite]] to the north, [[Veruhkt Plateau]] to the west and [[Spearhead Forest]] to the southwest.

The region is split by a river and lake into north and south segments. Highfall sits on an island at the mouth of the river. The southern segment includes grassland dotted with spruce and oak trees and a large peninsula with rocky, slightly-snowy terrain. In the northern segment are lowlands with small streams and spruce woods in the east, as well as dry land in the west, and highlands consisting of snow-covered tundra. Here, there are also several glaciers, acting as sources for rivers feeding into the eastern ocean.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**

- Rocky, hilly peninsula in the southeast <br>
- Small desert in the far west, along the mountains bordering the [[Veruhkt Plateau]] region <br>
- Snowy highland tundra in the east

The city of [[Highfall]] is found along the eastern coast of this region.

## History

In the early and/or mid-Second Avihm, the coastal city of Highfall began to climb in importance, becoming a profoundly wealthy hub of trade and commerce. It was also likely ruled by [[Virmari]] for much of its history. With the founding of the [[Empire of Vir]], Highfall became a center of political power (although it is unclear if it was the official capital). At the height of its opulence, it could be considered the greatest city in Drehmal.

After the Empire of Vir collapsed due to poor leadership and subsequent instability, Highfall retained its wealth and significance and continued to be ruled by a line of Virmari. [[Avsohm|The Empire of Avsohm's]] rise, however, meant bad news. The effects of the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] were devastating for Highfall, rendering the natural environment bleak, cold, and inhospitable, driving away trade and leaving the formerly rich citizens in poverty. [[Blue Exodus]] operatives (cooperating with Avsohm) assassinated the city's last Virmari king in Highfall Castle. The cause or consequences of this event are unclear, as it is not known if Avsohm assumed direct authority in the city, installed a puppet government, or didn't interfere afterwards.

Following [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's collapse]] (if the city was not already independent), the Kingdom of Highfall assumed power. Centuries later, the kingdom joined the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. However, they were discontented with the alliance's conditions, and fought in the [[Insohmic Civil War]] to secede. The separatists ultimately lost the war, meaning the kingdom was forced to stay in the Order. The Kingdom of Highfall would go on to fight with the Insohmic Coalition in the lengthy [[Battle for Drehmal]], before Insohm's fall. The kingdom still rules in the Fourth Avihm.

Worship of [[Virtuo]] is the most common local religion.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus Tower]]

> The Highfall Tundra tower.

Highfall Tundra's Terminus tower is located in the region's center, near the main road. Four stone towers with tops shaped like bird heads surround it on each side. The southern one, the shortest, has a spiral staircase on its interior leading to its top. A bridge connects the top of this tower to the eastern tower, which is taller. A stairwell inside this tower climbs from the point where the bridge intersects with it, up to its top, where another bridge connects to the taller northern tower. This pattern repeats up until the roof of the western and tallest stone tower, which provides direct access to the top of the Terminus tower. This complex is guarded by hostile strays named "Tower Defenders".

### Highfall

[[Highfall]] is a large city on the region's east coast, and the capital of the Kingdom of Highfall.

A series of of stone hallways are built into a mountain's interior in western Highfall Tundra. This crypt is filled with many bones, skulls and tombs, including that of an ancient, unnamed Virmari hero from the [[Deity War]]. A single hostile entity called the "Crypt Belcherest" guards the area.
