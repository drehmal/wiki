## Transcription
> I spent many good years as the Grand Councillor representing Akhlo'Rohma in the Insohmic Coalition, and it was always in lockstep with the Duspian Parliament. Not anymore.
>
> It might look now like I had planned all of this from the beginning, what with occupying the historic castle I myself spent so many years renovating, but that could not be much further from the truth.
>
> Yes, when Insohm fell, the situation was much less than ideal for me, politically. But Cerice was still so young. It seemed like it was time to move back to the family compound.
>
> But then came Ehzar Gohman from the tunnels beneath Ancehl, and rapidly he has gone from a suspicious tomb raider to one of my best friends. I've never met a smarter man in my life. None of the Grand Council could, that's for sure. And he has been incredibly kind to Cerice, bringing her delightful flowers and toys that seem intricate enough to be from Avsohmic times.
>
> Even now, he's mysterious, yes. Long years of experience make me wary of treachery. To this day, however, his suggestions continue to be wise and commonsense. And I cannot say that I dislike this new state of affairs.
>
> Though Parliament may not like it, I have the support of this region. Even in the streets of Dusps, the people are flying our new Ancehl colors.
>
> I fully admit that I relied on Ehzar's advice. But I think that I've done the right thing, not only for Cerice, but for the entire Long Rest.
>
> When I recover from illness, I will need to convene with Ehzar once again. Perhaps he will have some thoughts about how to expand our area of influence back to our people's traditional southern border in the Heartwood.
