## Transcription
> Q. The Exodus Citadel is already at the bottom of Lake Nimahj. Why did Blue Exodus build an even more secretive facility underneath it?
>
> A. The primary reason that the Vault exists is to protect crucial personnel and technology from attacks directed at the Citadel proper. Redundancy is key to resilience in the face of the enemy.
>
> Q. What happens in the Vault?
>
> A. Lots of things! Training, planning and coordination are some of the most important facets of Vault work. Prototype vehicle assembly and vehicle storage are also a constant demand. Finally, the Military Technology Department is headquartered in the Vault, and it devises the latest and greatest in new weaponry to serve Avsohm's needs.
>
> Q. Can I visit the Vault?
>
> A. Only with the express permission of your supervising officer. When allowed within the Vault, take the most direct path to your destination and do not deviate from your assigned course, or you will face punishment.
