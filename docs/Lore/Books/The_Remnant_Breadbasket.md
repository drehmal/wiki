## Transcription
> Even in death, Noha blesses her devout. In the bones of her great corpse, we cultivate crops, defend our community, and live happy lives. We have become a breadbasket amongst the wastes of the Golden Steppe, despite all that aligns against us. I doubt outsiders are even aware of us.
