# Maen

**Maen** (pronounced "main") is the Aspect of Pain. He is one of three children of [[Khive]], who represent the three Primal Emotions—[[Tethlaen|Fear]], Pain, and [[Moen|Pleasure]]. Maen lives in exile on the moon of [[Loruhn]].

## Characteristics

Maen's passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] is shared with his two siblings, and reads:

> Maen, Moen, and Tethlaen, the three Aspects of Emotion
> -------------------
> Created and maintain the Primal Emotions, all three of which are vital for functional souls. Moen lives on Lo'Dahr, Maen is shackled to Loruhn, and Tethlaen is widely believed to be dead after disappearing.

No depictions or descriptions of Maen's physical form are found in the map.

Maen is depicted as hateful, in line with his rule over pain.

## Role and Powers

Maen, as one of the Aspects of Emotion, seems to be responsible for managing the world's pain, presumably able to both inflict it and take it away on a fundamental level. This concept is not explored particularly deeply in official sources.

## In-Map References

There are multiple references to worship of Maen across Drehmal, with his followers often being labeled cultists. One such cultist was a member of the [[Hunting Party]] that killed Greatbeast [[Muhs]], hoping to inflict pain to honor Maen.

The Osaigah Clan, one of [[Sahd]]'s original three clans, appears to have worshipped Maen, feeding into the eventual Sahdan religion known as "The Path", where pain was seen as a tool that can be used for evil or good. This can be seen through the book [[An Elegy to Pain]] found near the [[Artifacts#Glorybringer|Glorybringer]] artifact.

Maen has both a room in [[Ytaj]] (pictured above with various torture implements) and [[Maen's Domain|a domain]] on [[Lo'Dahr]], found in the center of the moon's habitable area. The majority of Maen-related lore is found on Lo'Dahr, tied to the [[Divine Schism]].

From the tablets in Palaesida's room in Ytaj which paint a picture of the Schism's beginning, it is revealed that Maen played a significant role in this war between the Aspects. Initially holding a grudge against [[Palaesida]] for ruining a plan of his (it is unclear what this means), Maen harbored resentment against the Aspect of Storms for the duration of the Schism, likely fighting on the Anti-Palaesidan side of the war. At the conclusion of the Schism, with all of the Aspects meeting in the far northern [[Lunar Wastes]], Maen took the opportunity to surprise attack Palaesida, killing him and ending the war. For this transgression, however, Maen was permanently exiled to the barren moon of [[Loruhn]], where he remains shackled to this day.

The community reconstruction of the [[Codex Celestus]] mentions Maen, as [[Khive]] writes:

> My son shall never be physically seen again, by vote of the Council. Though I visit him often, and he continues dutifully to help balance the pain of the world, he is filled with a rage that grows every day.

This line is the source of the idea that Maen manages the world's pain in a manner more benevolent than one might initially expect, although he grows more furious the longer he is left in exile.
