**Malevolentia** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis. 

The signature weapon of the chaos deity [[Maelihs]], it is found in his chamber at the top of the [[Burnt Palace]]. The weapon itself is a unique mix of a sword and a trident, as the main blade appears to be a standard sword, but a three-pronged fork sits beneath the hilt, on the opposite end from the blade.

## Gameplay
Malevolentia is a heavily NBT-modified netherite sword, and behaves as such.

Malevolentia is optimal for a heavy tank build in Drehmal, as it gives the player complete immunity to knockback, adds 5 extra hearts to a player's max health, and deals significant damage, but has a slow attack speed. By default, the weapon is enchanted with Fire Aspect IV, two levels above the normal enchantment cap of Fire Aspect II. Practically, this means that a successful blow landed with Malevolentia will set the target on fire for twice as long as a hit from a sword enchanted with Fire Aspect II would, dealing a total of 15 fire damage (7.5 hearts) over the course of 16 seconds, in addition to the damage from the blow itself.

Malevolentia's special ability, Infernal Ground, allows the player to give themselves the Resistance effect in a certain radius of the weapon for up to 30 seconds by crouching and pressing their drop item key to throw the trident into the ground. This creates a copy of Malevolentia in the ground; the player can still use Malevolentia as a sword while this ability is in effect and during its cooldown.

**VERSION 2.2.1 AND BEFORE:** The ability has 4 discrete levels of effectiveness, denoted by the color of the bar when charging up the trident spike. These levels vary in their duration and area of effect, denoted by a ring of red particles. The cooldown time is the same regardless of the strength of the Infernal Ground. <br>
- Level 1: If thrown in roughly the first quarter of the charge-up, while the bar appears **yellow**, the radius of the effect is just under 2 blocks, and lasts for only 5 seconds. <br>
- Level 2: If thrown while the meter is between roughly 25% and 60% full, while the bar appears **orange**, the radius of the effect is approximately 4 blocks, and lasts for 15 seconds. <br>
- Level 3: If thrown towards the end of the meter but not at full charge, while the bar appears **light red**, the radius of the effect is approximately 5 blocks, and lasts for 20 seconds. <br>
- Level 4: If thrown while fully charged up, while the bar appears **dark red**, the radius of the effect is nearly 6 blocks, and lasts for a full 30 seconds.

**VERSION 2.2.2:** The same basic principle as above applies, but the level of Resistance has changed. Resistance 2 is granted at maximum charge, and anything else grants only Resistance 1.

??? warning "Late-Game Spoilers: Upgrades"
    Like the other Mythicals, Malevolentia can be upgraded with one of each Fervor Stone at the Soletta, increasing its health, cooldown, and movement speed bonuses. A fully upgraded Malevolentia grants the player +14 Max Health (+7 Hearts), has a smaller movement speed penalty of -0.01, and has a special ability cooldown of only 15 seconds.

## How to Obtain
Malevolentia is one of the more straightforward mythical weapons to obtain, simply being at the end of a dungeon. At the [[Burnt Palace]], in the center of the [[Hellcrags]], the player must fight their way through the [[Maelmari]] palace guards, climbing through the palace all the way to the chamber at its peak. Here, in Mael's bedchamber, there is a small balcony overlooking the entrance to the palace. Malevolentia is found floating here, at (-3983, 139, 5959), and can be picked up with a right click.

## Lore

The name "Malevolentia" is derived from the term "malevolent," meaning "having or showing a wish to do evil to others." This runs parallel to the Maelihs himself, derived from the word "malice." 

Malevolentia was the weapon of Maelihs himself, as shown in [official Drehmal promotional art](https://www.drehmal.net/product-page/the-desecration-of-virtuo-poster), and learned through the lore text of the weapon. After the departure of [[Virtuo]] at the end of Av3, Maelihs cast the weapon aside, leaving the sword where the player finds it and departing the [[Burnt Palace]], possibly for [[LD|Lo'Dahr]].

On the divine moon, [[Maelihs]] can be found alive and well, residing in the tall western tower at [[Ytaj]]. Here, he can be spoken to, and he has [[Mael Dialogue#Malevolentia Dialogue|special dialogue]] if the player approaches him with Malevolentia in hand. He states that the blade was "forged of my own blood and rage," and expresses his joy at having learned that the player killed most or all of his Maelmari. He ultimately wishes the player well, allowing them to keep the weapon.
