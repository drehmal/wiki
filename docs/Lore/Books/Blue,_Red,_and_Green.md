## Transcription
> Avsohm has selected us, Blue Exodus, to be a part of the exclusive group known as the "Big Three". We shall operate as a military and construction organization, taking contracts from the government. The other two members of this group are Red Dawn, a scientifically-focused alchemical group, and Green Serpent, an organization focused around commerce and trade.
