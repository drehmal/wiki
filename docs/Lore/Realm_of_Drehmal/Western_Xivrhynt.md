# Western Xivrhynt

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

**Western Xivrhynt** is the name given to the mysterious continent located far to the west of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] on the [[Disc]], only mentioned very sparingly. A remnant of the world in the First Avihm, Western Xivhrynt is brought up only a few times in-game, and does not actually exist on the map.
