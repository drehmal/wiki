### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in [[Loeturia]]. Written by one of the [[Drehmari]] inhabitants of Loeturia, referred to as the only place on [[Lo'Dahr]] welcoming of Drehmari who are not part of a coven. The author has been tasked with gathering gifts for visitors to the town, offering an opportunity to see outside the town's walls fo the first time in the months they have lived there.

### Transcription:
> Preceptor Ygis requested of me to gather more presents and keepsakes for our visitors! I'm so happy, Drehmari like me never get permission to leave the confines of Loeturia's protecting walls! This is the only place on Lo'Dahr truly welcoming of uncovened Drehmari visitors, but it's a real shame that the environment outside the walls is so hostile to us. I've been staying here a while now, outcast by my family - but I was able to try a fresh start here! Preceptor Ygis is one of Glacial Elder Loe's most trusted, and the fact that he's trusting me with the gathering of gifts is amazing! In my months here I've only glimpsed outside the walls, they don't want us undedicated to be wandering around outside. Something about being "for our own safety" and how "after the last batch of undedicated visitors, most Tehrmari won't take kindly to your presence.". Preceptor Ygis gave me a Seal of Loe as proof of my concord with the people of Loeturia, so if anyone gives me any trouble I'm supposed to just show it to them. I was told to look specifically for aurora tears and everice fragments, and if I do well they might let me tag along on a caravan and see other parts of Lo'Dahr! Just need to make sure I steer clear of the golems if I want to keep my antlers free of icicles.
