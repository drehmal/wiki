The Insohmic Civil War was a conflict fought between separatist member states wanting to secede from the Order of Insohm and loyalist member states wanting to keep the alliance together. The Tidal Dynasty also joined partway through against the loyalists. The timeline of the war is recounted in detail by the book [[The Insohmic Civil War]]. 

## Background

The Order of Insohm was less than a century old when it threatened to fracture. For unknown reasons, the Kingdom of Dusps, Kingdom of Highfall and the remnants of old Faehrcylian tribes had intentions to leave the Order in the late Av3 500s. Non-governmental militias likely posed the greatest threat to any country that tried to break away. This resulted in the 600th Massacre in Av3 600, when these militias were slaughtered by the militaries of separatist states. The other Insohmic member states promptly declared war on the separatists.

## War

For most of the decade, the two sides battled and raided each other with weaponized airships. A loyalist airship accidentally passed over the Tidal Dynasty at one point, and the Tide Queen thought they were being attacked, and so she declared war on the loyalists. 

The Tidal Dynasty attempted to invade Gozaki terriory, but were soundly defeated at the Battle of Kozdan in Av3 609. A heavy blow was dealt to their forces, so they left the war. The loyalists, now with increased morale, pushed into the Kingdom of Highfall laid siege to [the capital[Highfall]]. They succeeded and occupied the city the following year. In Av3 611, the loyalist armies invaded the Kingdom of Dusps, who surrendered after the capture of the city Sahvoltha. The Faehrcylian tribes, now alone, followed soon after, officially ending the war.

## Impact

The Insohmic Civil War was the greatest threat to the stability of the Order. The loyalist's victory meant that the Order of Insohm continued to exist, and would go on to fight the [[Tidal War]] less than a decade after the end of the Civil War, and the large-scale [[Battle for Drehmal]] later still.
