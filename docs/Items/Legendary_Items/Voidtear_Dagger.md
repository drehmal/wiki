## Gameplay
The Voidtear Dagger is an NBT-modified iron sword, inheriting that base durability.

The dagger gives its wielder invisibility, and significantly lowers the aggro range for nearby mobs. Its main ability is the ability to throw it forward using the drop item key, dealing damage as a projectile. Afterwards, it will fall to the ground. The player who threw it will retain their invisibility for up to 5 seconds after throwing, which is refreshed if they pick it back up within that time frame. 

The dagger also deals more damage to enemies from behind.

## How to Obtain
Voidtear Dagger is the only legendary/mythical that was outright moved in the 2.2.2 update.

In the [[Exodus Vault]], a new room has been added in the 2.2.2 update, next to the room with a map of Drehmal in the southeast of the facility. Here, the Voidtear Dagger hangs on the wall, and must be acquired while in Adventure Mode.

## Lore
The Voidtear Dagger that the player finds is one of many, which were utilized by assassins employed by the [[Blue Exodus]] group. Some of these Voidtear Assassins can still be found on the map by the player, as enemies in certain late-game areas. These enemies wield two Voidtear Daggers, and are otherwise completely invisible.

## Extras

### Changelog

Voidtear Dagger received a complete overhaul in the 2.2.2 update, including a new location and core gameplay mechanic. The following is the "Gameplay" section for the 2.2.1 and earlier version of Voidtear:

Voidtear is a legendary weapon that an entire build can form around, as it makes both stealth attacks and sneaking past hostile mobs a completely viable playstyle. The weapon gives a movement speed boost, and does mediocre damage but has a very fast attack speed, making it best utilized for quick flurries of action.

The weapon's main feature comes from its special ability. Not only does this apply the invisibility effect to its user, it also decreases the distance at which hostile mobs will notice and attack the player while invisible. This makes sneaking through some combat encounters not only possible, but very doable in many locations.
