### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in an item frame behind the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. It is not a writable book, and serves as a hint to the accepted [[Devotion]] gifts for [[Virtuo]].

### Transcription:
> When Virtuo left, She took most of her Virmari with her. But while some left the faith in disgust, the faith of most Drehmari have not shaken. In **Parishes all across the East**, we of the lesser race continue to leave offerings at **Her statues**. We all know that our kind and noble Goddess will soon return!
