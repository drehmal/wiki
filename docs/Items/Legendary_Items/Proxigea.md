**Proxigea** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The only legendary trident in Drehmal, Proxigea was hand-crafted by the Sea Aspect [[Dahr]] himself in Av1, and it is found in-game as a token of his favor, within [[Dahr's Domain|his domain]].

## Gameplay
Proxigea is an NBT-modified trident.

Dealing significant damage at baseline, Proxigea can be a very strong weapon on land, dealing 21 damage when thrown and 12 damage on a melee attack, equivalent to some other legendary swords.

It can be thrown freely due to its Loyalty enchantment, although the level of that enchantment can be upgraded to make it return faster.

Proxigea becomes even stronger when its ability is activated, however. If the player is touching water, then they receive a 30% increase to their attack damage, attack speed, and armor, making Proxigea a must-have for aquatic combat.

## How to Obtain
Proxigea is given as a reward for defeating [[The Vehrniis]], a massive sea serpent boss found in [[Challenger's Grotto]].

Defeating The Vehrniis opens a door in the northern side of the arena, leading to a small cavern that can be used to exit the area back to the surface. However, before this, the player can swim to the bottom of a flooded area to find a chest containing Proxigea.

## Lore
As its item description states, [[Dahr]] created Proxigea as a mocking gift to an "empire of purity" in Av1, knowing that even a weapon as powerful as this would not be able to stand up to his own power. This empire is very likely the [[Viruhn]], an ancient empire from Av1 that is assumed to have lived in the eastern portion of the modern-day continent of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] and possibly what is now [[Eastern Xivrhynt]].
