## Transcription
> Throughout countless generations, my family had lived life guarded by fear, protected by caution and our natural intuition. It is the crux of survival, not just for Drehmari, but for all the realm's creations. That is what the Aspect of Fear taught us. He was our guardian, our considerate overseer.
>
> He saved us once. Not even the most storied scholars remember, but the Harbinger himself attempted to save the realm. He was the noble knight with nobler intentions. His scales shone like black armor, his wings a great billowing cape, and his claws were the straight blade to pierce a heart of evil.
>
> That once noble Aspect lies dead. It is clear; I now fear the dark as if I were a small child. A carcass's rows of sharpened teeth make me cower in fear. Worst of all, I fear flame, and want nothing more than to embrace Faehrcyle's fields of cold, dead ice.
>
> I leave to the East, to Highfall, as far away from that northern mountain as possible. It is fear's grave. I will not grace it with my presence. I will betray my conscious no longer. In the end, I still trust my instincts, my deepest fears... yet I run and hide. I do not rise and overcome.
>
> I am ashamed.
