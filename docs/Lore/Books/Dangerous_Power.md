## Transcription
> I have sent a letter to Emperor Anyr's desk to request the immediate termination of the Yavhlix operations due to the recent investigations conducted by some of the facility's senior members. What lies beyond that rift is something we have no business with. The power we are granted is immense, but with what little knowledge we have of the substance and its origins, it is safe to say that we should stop its collection at once. Perhaps in the future, once we gain more information on the subject, we can restart the operation. As it stands, the continued collection of Primal Energy represents a wildly dangerous threat to the continued and prosperous existence of the entire Empire.
