**Eldermead** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The only consumable legendary item, Eldermead is a gift from [[Vayniklah|Life-Bringer Vayniklah]], awarded upon completion of her trial. It is a very strong healing item, which can be used 5 times before depleted and permanently destroyed (although more can be crafted).

When drunk, Eldermead restores 4 hunger haunches, and applies two effects: 10 seconds of Regeneration II (restoring up to 4 Hearts) and 2 minutes of Absorption II (providing an extra 4 absorption hearts). Eldermead can be consumed 5 times, with its fullness level indicated by the different item sprites. Once empty, it can be re-crafted into another full bottle. Crafting an Eldermead requires crafting this special empty bottle first.

## How to Obtain
Eldermead is obtained as a reward for completing Vayniklah's trial at the Temple of Life in [[Vayniklah's Domain|her domain]].

For a guide to the puzzle at this location and the trial itself, see the main [[Temple of Life]] page.

The Temple of Life puzzle involves observing the surroundings and discerning patterns in the environment, then reporting these findings in the central structure. Once this has been done, a chest appears in the center of the temple, containing one Eldermead and the [[The Facets#Facet VI|sixth Facet]].

## Lore
The lore on Eldermead mostly comes from its item description, which states that it is usually kept for healing [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and La'Tehrmari, making it not only very exclusive, but extremely powerful, capable of healing gods. However, this is not the only connection between [[Vayniklah]] and mead, as some of her accepted devotion items can be ascertained from mead distilling stations found throughout [[Akhlo'Rohma]], which contain secret ingredients that can be offered to her at [[Marahza]].

## Extras

### Changelog

Version 2.2.2 made Eldermead stronger, increasing its number of uses from 3 to 5. It also added the special Eldermead bottle, which is required to craft Eldermead and is also given when the item is fully used. Previously, the item would simply disappear upon its third and final use.
