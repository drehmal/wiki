The **Primary Energy Collection Facility** (also referred to simply as the **Primary Collection Facility**, or misleadingly as **Mt. Yavhlix**) is an Avsohmic facility built within [[Mt. Yavhlix]], built to harness the power of a tear that supplied the vast majority of the empire's [[Primal Energy]]. It is a major milestone in the story of Drehmal, typically being done after the player has explored the majority of the world, and marking the beginning of the [end-game](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/End-Game_Locations/).

## Story
Throughout the realm of Drehmal, several passing references are made to Mt. Yavhlix and to this facility in particular, concerning the events that unfolded here preceding and during the [[Fall of Avsohm]]. The events at Mt. Yavhlix are suggested to have been pivotal in the fall of Avsohm, with the empire's doom perhaps even originating in this facility, and the majority of its story can be pieced together before ever entering this facility. All of this information is brought together within the facility, tying together some of the final strings.

The player can only access the Primary Collection Facility by completing the [[Story Progression#Mythbreaker Run (LATE-GAME SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)|Mythbreaker Run]], using the Charged version of the [[Mythbreaker]] to break down the veilstone seal that blocks access to the facility. At this point, [[Khive]] will warn the player not to hark to the whispers within the mountain.

Once inside, the player finds that the facility itself takes the form of a castle-like structure. As soon as they enter the mountain's interior, the player will be [[Mt._Yavhlix_Dialogue.md|spoken to]] by a mysterious voice, doing so by changing the names of whatever item is in their hand to a short message, for a few seconds at a time. This voice initially appears to be taunting the player, but over time, it becomes clear that the voice is pushing the player to complete an unclear goal, stating that they have been "chosen" and that they are special, not like others who have tried before. 

The player proceeds through the facility, uncovering the aftermath of the events at the mountain (expanded upon in the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility#Lore|Lore]] section). Here, it is learned that the fall of Avsohm began at this very facility, with the unleashing of beings known only as "Those Beyond." These beings, which appeared as dark orbs, consumed many of the workers at the facility and portions of the building itself, drilling perfectly circular holes into the people until they were completely consumed, presumably ceasing to exist. From here, these beings spread out to the rest of Avsohm, thoroughly decimating nearly the entirety of the empire's higher-ranking officials and completely crippling their infrastructure in less than a day. 

Holotexts throughout the facility contain the testaments of workers who died in Yavhlix, often capturing their final moments or mad, panicked ramblings. 

By proceeding through the facility and flipping three override switches, the player can gain access to the tear itself at the very top of the facility. Entering through the tear takes the player to [[The Nothing]], the culmination of the initial Mt. Yavhlix story sequence. Completing the goal in The Nothing is NOT the end of the story, but rather, the beginning of what this wiki refers to as the "end-game."

## Gameplay
The player is NOT placed into Adventure Mode inside of the Primary Collection Facility, remaining in Survival Mode with the ability to place and break blocks.

As soon as the player enters the facility, they begin to hear whispers, depicted by briefly changing the name of an item in the player's hand to a short message before changing it back to its normal name. This form of dialogue carries on until the player has completed the main objective in [[The Nothing]], initially following a set progression but repeating the message "NOTHING TO LOSE." indefinitely if dialogue is exhausted.

There is a well-known bug[^2] which can occur in this area relating to this dialogue function, which affects items with custom NBT data in runic vessels (shulker boxes).

The facility is home to several very strong enemies, almost all of whom appear to be Avsohmic officers and workers lost to the Nothing. This includes one of the strongest regular enemies in the game, the Lost Avsohmic Commanders, who appear multiple times in this area, and are outfitted with celestial armor. Re-skinned Ravagers, named "Dwellers," can also be found in parts of the facility's sewer system, as well as "Lulls," custom Phantom mobs, which spawn along the edges of the facility.

The primary mode of progression within Mt. Yavhlix is finding three override switches, levers on a single block of bedrock that, when toggled, trigger a message in chat. When all three levers have been located and flipped, the seal at the top of the facility is lifted, allowing for entrance into the tear itself.

??? question "Override Switch #1"
    The first lever is found at the very beginning of the climb through the facility. When approaching the facility from the main bridge, this lever is found directly past the iron door in the center of the building, just before a staircase upwards to a room filled with enemies, at approximately (26907, 63, -162).

??? question "Override Switch #2"
    The second lever is found deeper into the facility and slightly higher, just above a large soul sand pit, at approximately (26901, 75, -102).

??? question "Override Switch #3"
    The third lever is found near the top of the facility, along the front outside wall, in a heavily guarded area - approximately (26928, 112, -136).

Players familiar with the Minecraft base game will instantly recognize the structure of this primal energy tear: the Minecraft End Portal. Scattered throughout the facility in chests are Oculi of Nothing ![Oculus](/assets/img/oculus_of_nothing.png){ width="24" }, Drehmal's version of Eyes of Ender. Just as in the Minecraft base game, filling the empty portal frame with 12 Oculi of Nothing will override the seal on the tear, allowing entry into the Nothing by jumping into the opened portal.

## Original Writing
There are [11 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Mt._Yavhlix_Dungeon/) to be found at the Primary Collection Facility, all in various states of disrepair after being partially (or, in some cases, mostly) consumed by holes, the same fate as most of the people at this location.

Additionally, there are 9 different lore books to be found inside the Primary Collection Facility: <br>
- [[Cooling Systems]] <br>
- [[Evacuation Orders]] <br>
- [[Hole-Filled Notebook]] <br>
- [[Letter from Gohri]] <br>
- [[Madman's Notes]] <br>
- [[Madman's Scrawl]] <br>
- [[Patron's Pleas]] <br>
- [[The Pipes]] <br>
- [[They've Been Lost]] 

## Lore
The history of the Primary Collection Facility is quite possibly the most important piece to understanding the reason for Avsohm's meteoric rise to power, as well as their ultimate catastrophic fall. 

The tear at Mt. Yavhlix was first discovered by Avsohmic survey drones early in the empire's history, under the reign of [[Drehn Mal'Sohm]]. Understanding the potential power that such a massive supply of [[Primal Energy]] could give them, Avsohm advanced on the mountain, waging war against the native tribes of [[Faehrcyle]], which ultimately resulted in the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]]. This event was an ecological disaster, making the entirety of Faehrcyle effectively uninhabitable and drastically changing the climate of several northern regions, but Avsohm was able to secure passage to the mountain nonetheless. 

The mountain was dug into, and Avsohm discovered the tear that the survey drones had been picking up. The facility was constructed around the tear in order to draw from its power, and expeditions into the tear were conducted as well. 

Initially, the facility warranted the construction and maintenance of numerous massive pipes, used to carry primal energy across Drehmal. These pipes can be seen prominently in the northern regions around Mt. Yavhlix, most notably [[Faehrcyle]] and [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. However, with the advent of Avsohmic warp technology and the creation of the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]], the pipes became obsolete, as energy could be transferred wirelessly across the continent using this transportation network.

However, this power did not come without a price. Beyond the Frostfang Catastrophe, itself a world-changing event, operations within the mountain were far from smooth in the beginning. Shortly after the foundation of the facility and the first expeditions into the tear, an incident occurred in which nearly all of the workers within the mountain were driven insane, with many of them dying and the others all reduced to rambling lunatics, save for [[Orix Cehein]]. Another account describes a strange, bizarre creature coming forth from the tear, appearing as a Drehmari made entirely out of tar, warning the workers to abandon the site before melting into a puddle.

For many years after these initial struggles, however, it appears that operations at the facility were mostly normal. Multiple prominent Avsohmic figures spent time in residence at Yavhlix, including [[Orix Cehein]], [[Thresa Vera]], [[Eleis]], [[Hirhla]], and [[Cehva]].

The beginning of [[Fall of Avsohm|the end]] for Avsohm seems to have taken place at this very facility. Shortly before the fall, [[Orix Cehein|Orix]] was made aware of increased reports of instability beyond the tear, and quickly left, placing the veilstone seal over the facility before departing for the [[Stasis Facility]]. One fateful day in Av2 1820, from the depths of the facility, Those Beyond were allowed to enter the realm of Drehmal. Perfectly circular beings of pure darkness, they consumed nearly everything in their path, either corrupting or completely erasing nearly everyone in the Primary Collection Facility, and through unclear means, were able to do the same to other members of Avsohm's government across the realm. Very, very few were spared, and it appears from multiple sources that anyone who saw the creatures became a victim themselves. This means that the security cameras in other locations focused on Yavhlix may have effectively started the outbreak of perfectly circular holes, as attested to by [one holotext](aphelion_yav.md) aboard [[The Aphelion]].

It appears that some of the workers did survive this event, but those who did were either corrupted by forces far beyond their understanding, or starved after being locked inside of the facility. To the best of our knowledge, it has remained untouched since that day, up until the point that the player unlocks it.

## Extras
Far in the back of the cave that the facility sits in, to the right (west), a chest with a unique sword can be found. This netherite sword, named "A Dumb Sword," has every single enchantment in the game.

[^2]: While in Mt. Yavhlix, the item-name dialogue feature should not affect the NBT data of any held items—for example, Mythical and Legendary weapons may have their names changed, but this should not affect their functionality at all. However, it is known that if the player places or holds a shulker box containing other items with custom NBT data (enchanted books, artifacts, custom weapons, or any other items that Drehmal re-skins), the NBT data of the items inside the shulker can be erased. Therefore, it is recommended that you as the player refrain from bringing shulker boxes into Mt. Yavhlix, but if you must do so, then try to avoid storing anything valuable with custom NBT data in that shulker box.
