> In my pursuit for writing a peer-published journal of the great bridge, I have discovered some curiosities that have stumped me. There are three towers with strange, floating crystals above them. They are located all over this valley, no more than 250 meters away from the bridge. They all have Avsohmic piping connecting them to the bridge, so they undoubtedly have a connection. There's wild energy sprites in two of them, and a system of pipes in the other. I'm afraid of destroying any piping or gathering proper equipment to deal with the sprites, so I am unable to explore them further.
