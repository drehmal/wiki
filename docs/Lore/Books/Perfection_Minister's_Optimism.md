## Transcription
> When Virtuo left, She took most of her Virmari with her. But while some left the faith in disgust, the faith of most Drehmari have not shaken. In **Parishes all across the East**, we of the lesser race continue to leave offerings at **Her statues**. We all know that our kind and noble Goddess will soon return!
