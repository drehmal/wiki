The **Administrative (Admin) Wing** of the [[Av'Sal Repository]] is the setting for the first portion of the 75% completion event, unlocked after reaching 75% tower linkage (24 towers). A comparatively small area compared to the other story locations, the Admin Wing is an extension of the Repository, offering a few small teasers towards the rest of the 75% completion event and the future of the story, as well as establishing another puzzle mechanic that appears again later in the map's story.

The Admin Wing can be accessed through a somewhat hidden room in the lower levels of Av'Sal's central island. Entry is possible before the 75% milestone, but requires knowledge that is strongly hinted at by [holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/75_Percent_Areas/Admin_Wing/) which are only readable after reaching 75% network linkage.

    These coordinates are directly in front of the entrance to the Admin Wing.

## Story (75% Completion Event)
Upon reaching 75% network linkage (24 towers), the player will be prompted by [[avSYS]] to enter the [[Terminus Network|Terminus's]] compass dispensary, where they will be given a lodestone compass that points towards the entrance to the admin wing of the Repistory. At the entrance to the admin wing, the player can re-sync the area's holotext database if they have 75% linkage, with one holotext positioned at the entrance that provides a hint for how to get in.

When the puzzle is solved, the player can drop down a newly-opened shaft into the Admin Wing, first coming across what appears to be a command room before descending into a hallway. Several rooms branching off of this hallway contain holotexts and loot, with the holotexts beginning to hint at the direction of the story's end-game, mentioning a mysterious "Apotheosis" plan created by [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]].

At the western end of the hallway is a room with two holotexts and a lever, sitting atop a piece of yellow concrete. Pulling this lever updates the player's security clearance with avSYS, and relays an SOS message from Commander Verpyne of the [[Aphelion]], directing the player towards the next phase of the 75% event:

At the other end of the hallway, a lever can be pulled to open a door to the main repository hall.

## Gameplay
At the entrance to the admin wing, the player must learn a new mechanic in order to unlock this section of the repository. The solution is given by the [[admin_security.md|holotext]] at the entrance, which can only be read after the admin wing holotexts have been restored.

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    As the holotext suggests, the security checkpoint only opens if a successful security scan can be completed. This requires the player to stand on the scanner (orange stained glass platform), with all armor removed, for about 10-15 seconds. After doing so, a sound effect will play, and a passage opens up in the floor, allowing access to the admin wing.

Once in the admin wing, there is one custom enemy, Lost Advisor Grovahn, a custom mob mentioned in a book found nearby. 

## Original Writing
The admin wing contains [6 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/75_Percent_Areas/Admin_Wing/).

The admin wing also contains two original lore books. <br>
- [[Intelligence Officer's Draft]] contains a partial account of an Avsohmic intelligence officer's reports on happenings around the empire. <br>
- [[Thought-recording_of_Ekari,_Number_8710.md|Thought-recording of Ekari, Number 8710]] is a journal of [[Ekari]], seemingly written as they were designing the architecture for the facility at [[Sal'Mevir]].

## Lore
The admin wing, while not constituting a large amount of time spent in the map, does appear to have been an important location for Avsohm. Only high-ranking officers were granted access, and several important figures appear to have spent time here, including [[Thresa Vera]], [[Zevve Kai]], Ekari, Ahdul, Achet, and judging by the presence of a throne in the upper room, possibly the sitting [emperors](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Emperors/) of Avsohm.
