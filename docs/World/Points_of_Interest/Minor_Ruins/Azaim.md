# Azaim

![[azaim.png]]

**Azaim** is a ruined, abandoned city in northern [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. Settled by migrants from [[Casai]] after the great exodus out of that region due to the [[Dune Wars]], it has a distinct architectural style, and contains remnants of the syncretic Casain-Akhlo'Rohman culture.

## Layout/Points of Interest

Azaim is built almost entirely out of orange concrete and bricks, highly reminiscent of the Casain Quarter of [[Dusps]].

A ruined structure in the northwest holds the [[Simplicity's Reward]] book, which contains one resident's poetic account of the [[Fall of Avsohm]].

The largest onion-domed building to the south has an upper balcony, with a chest containing the [[Artifacts#Quailfeather Helm|Quailfeather Helm]].

To the northeast, just outside of the town proper, a large black grave can be found, at the eastern end of a larger graveyard. This grave contains the unique [[Artifacts#Totem of Dying|Totem of Dying]] artifact.

## Lore

The town of Azaim was once a larger population center. It appears to have been either founded by Casain migrants as part of the Casain Migration in early Av3, or experienced a large population boom due to this influx of migrants. Either way, the [[Voynahla]]-worshipping Casains brought their religion and culture to this city.

The Simplicity's Reward book, if it was written here, would possibly contradict the idea that the city was settled by Casains, as the Fall of Avsohm would have been before the Casain Migration.

The town appears to have been wiped out in an event referred to as "Gendrik's Incursion", related to the [[Maelmari]]. This has been hypothesized to be a large-scale Maelmari raid on the Akhlo'Rohman countryside, following the collapse of [[Insohm]].

## Extras

While the onion domes here are a hallmark of Casain architecture, the fact that their copper is green is different from Dusps. This is likely due to the fact that this place has been abandoned for years, and so the copper is old and has not been cleaned.
