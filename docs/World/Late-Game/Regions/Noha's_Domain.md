## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[noha_domain.png]]

**Noha's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the deceased Aspect of Meadows, [[Noha]]. This region starkly contrasts with itself, primarily being made up of dead, decayed grasslands and rolling hills. There is a single thriving, grassy village at its center, [[Lajani]], built within the bones of Noha herself. The region is located at the central-eastern edge of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the north, [[Nahyn's Domain]] to the west, and [[Rihelma's Domain]] to the south.

## Geography

Noha's Domain is divided neatly into two parts by a wide, winding river that originates in the west (from Nahyn's Domain), loops around the northern end of Lajani, and flows into Rihelma's Domain in the southeast. North of this river, the terrain is almost entirely barren, composed of exposed dirt, obsidian, and strange black/yellow obelisks, with large mountains toward the eastern border. South of this river is mostly flat, with Lajani sitting upon a small hill, and the terrain gradually sloping down towards Rihelma's Domain.

Towards the south, some of the large purple crystals from Rihelma's Domain have also begun floating into this region.

## Gameplay

Custom teleporting ocelots with the name "**Endercat**" spawn in Noha's Domain.

Vanilla Endermen and Chthonic Skeletons (Wither Skeletons) also spawn in Noha's Domain.

## History

Noha's Domain was once an incredibly lush steppe, known by its inhabitants as the "Golden Steppe," tended to by the Aspect of Harvest herself. [[Mili's Curiosity|One book]] found in Lajani even claims that it was once the single largest settlement in all of Lo'Dahr.

This region was impacted perhaps more than any other by the events of the [[Divine Schism]]. In late Av2, the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] resulted in the permanent freezing over of [[Faehrcyle]], a region on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] that was extremely dear to the Aspect of Meadows' heart, and she took her own life. In turn, her region seems to have died around her, turning from the breadbasket of the entire moon into a barren, desolate series of hills, inhabited by hostile and unfamiliar creatures.

However, life in the region was able to persist, thanks to the fact that Noha's corpse itself was still present in the remnants of Lajani. Thanks to some combination of Noha's corpse fertilizing the soil and her innate divine magic, Lajani and its immediate surroundings remain fertile and safe, well over a millennium later. The town suffered a significant mass exodus immediately following the Divine Schism, but the handful of [[Tehrmari]] still living there are well-fed, and isolated from the dangers present elsewhere on the moon.

### Gateway (Exit)

A quartz gateway can be found inside the large black mountain just southeast of Lajani, although it cannot be activated from this side.

??? warning "Gate Info"
    This gateway is one of 6 portals between [[Overworld|Drehmal]] and [[Lo'Dahr]], and this one in particular is linked to the portal created at Project ArkAngel, just behind the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. This gate can only be activated from the Drehmal side.

### Lajani

![[lajani.png]]

[[Lajani]] is the only remaining major settlement in Noha's Domain, and the remnant of what was once a thriving, bustling community. It is built around the bones of [[Noha]] herself.

Lajani is also a separate Minecraft biome from the rest of Noha's Domain—a Cherry Grove biome—allowing it to retain the vibrant color and precipitation of the region from before its patron Aspect died.
