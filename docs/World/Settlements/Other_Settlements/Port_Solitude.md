# Port Solitude

![[port_solitude.png]]

**Port Solitude** is a settlement on the southern shores of the ruined [[South Heartwood]], home to a mix of [[Drehmari]] and passive [[Mihkmari]], the only place in the map where non-hostile pillagers can be found. It is also the site of [[Dahr]]'s [[devotion]] altar.

    Approximate Coordinates: `1870, 67, 4258`

Entering the town for the first time grants the "Avast!" advancement.

## Layout

Most buildings in Port Solitude follow a similar building pallette, with wooden buildings made up of spruce planks, oak logs, and stripped jungle wood, while the roofs follow a red-orange gradient of red concrete, red terracotta, and orange terracotta.

The upper level of the town is mostly made up of residential buildings, including a home at the western end that seemingly once belonged to [[Devro Ihb]], as evidenced by the [[Diary of Devro Ihb]] found there. The main exception to this rule is the red sandstone building in the west, which is the site of Dahr's devotion shrine.

The lower level is where Port Solitude's actual docks are, as well as four unique, shady merchants.

## Dahr Devotion Guide

Around Dahr's shrine, players can find low-level offerings such as ink sacs, tropical fish, and sea pickles. The [[Sea-Priest's Musings]] book provides the following hint:

> On a foggy day, I invite in any captain that arrives in port for a drink and a prayer. They're either a fellow saltblood who knows to place an offering to Dahr **on the prow of their ship**, or they're a living corpse who needs every bit of help they can get from a priest like me. Either way, it's a good time.

Hints as to higher-tier offerings are found at the front of several ships throughout the realm.

??? info "Hint Locations"
    Ships with Dahr devotion items on their prows can be found docked at: [[Mohta]], [[Tahva]], [[Port Solitude]], the [[Kiln of Virtuo]], [[Firteid]], and [[Mossfield]].

## Lore

Port Solitude is a haven for pirates and sailors, existing in the now-lawless region of Mael's Desolation. As the home of many seafarers, it is a central hub for worship of [[Dahr]], the Aspect of the Sea. It is unclear when exactly Port Solitude was founded, although its continued existence in Av4 and lack of nearby ruins suggests that it was built (or rebuilt) after the Desolation of the South Heartwood in early Av3.
