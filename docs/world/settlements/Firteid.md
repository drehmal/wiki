## Lore

Firtied first came to be with he formation of the Tidal Dynasty under the rule of the Tide Queen, a drehmari of unknown name and origin processing unlimited potentia, which she used to make herself immortal. The Tidal Dynasty quickly expanded, conquering the whole of the Black Jungle before fortifying their defenses and evolving into a totalitarian dictatorship to protect the Tide Queen. The powerful defenses meant a large military force, which the Tide Queen used to expand her kingdoms further into the Heartwood, capturing the coasts previously controlled by Gozak. Fearing her ruthlessness, the Avsohmic empire attempted an offensive against the Tide Queen and her kingdom, but was bested by the treacherous Black Jungle. Following the attack the Tide Queen ordered a state of isolation on Av2 1569. Soon after, Virtuo had reemerged, threatening the Tide Queens rule, who decided her best option was to declare herself a devout follower as to twist her populations view of the goddess and limited who was to enter [[The_Kiln|the Kiln of Virtuo]] east of the Firtied to ascend and become virmari. During this time, the Queen committed many more atrocities, culling those she deemed impure under Virtuo. Despite the Queen's actions, Virtuo did not act in fear of inciting a war, and her inaction lead to many more deaths. As Avsohm began dispatching surveillance drones, the Tide Queen ordered each one located over the Tidal Dynasties land be destroyed so that the Tide Queen could continue her method of leadership. In early Av3, the Tidal Dynasty had suffered with the many events of the time, but the Tide Queen only grew more confident, having spent centuries studying the blade with her infamous Masayoshi. In Av3 436, the Tide Queen lifted the isolation of her kingdom, being confident enough in her abilities to defend herself. However, this allowed the newly formed Insohmic Empire to learn of her tyranny and In Av3 628, councilman Hovadchear and a group of highly trained soldiers, backed by Virtuo, successfully assassinated the Tide Queen, ending her reign and allowing Insohm into the Black Jungle, but leading to the great Tide War.
