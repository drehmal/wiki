The **Augural Tangle** is a hidden dungeon within Aldregakar, the massive mountain in the southeast of [[Rihelma's Domain]]. Full of divining crystals which are said to allow people to peer into the mind of [[Rihelma]] as she receives prophecies, the Augural Tangle is also the final resting place of [[Oriann]], and the location of the [[Aeongale]] legendary.

First entering the Augural Tangle grants the "Augural Tangle" advancement.

## Entering the Tangle

Discovering and entering the Augural Tangle can be quite difficult. Its existence is hinted at by some of the content on Lo'Dahr revolving around [[Rihelma]], particularly the lore book [[The Augury]]. 

The actual structure can only be accessed in one way. From the summit of Aldregakar, a river flows into a large circular hole, forming a waterfall and depositing into a lake. Behind this waterfall is a cave, which leads deep into the mountain. As the tunnel gets very narrow, a small opening can be climbed through to the right. Follow this path up and to the right, until it turns from terracotta to dripstone blocks. Turn left at the dripstone blocks, and you will emerge at the start of the Augural Tangle.

## Contents

The Augural Tangle is a very linear experience, centered around eight lamps. Signs at the first lamp read:

> EIGHT LAMPS <br>
> FIND YOUR PATH 
>
> ONE GATE <br>
> SEE YOUR FUTURE

![[tangle_activate.png]]
> An Augural Tangle lamp being activated.

The lamps must be activated in order, starting next to these signs. Lamps are activated by having a player stand next to them for about 30 seconds, indicated by a progress bar over the hotbar and swirling particle effects. Lamps with an orange flarepod (shroomlight) in the center are ready to be activated, and this central block turns into a sea lantern when they have been lit.

Activating the first lamp will make the next lamp ready, following in sequence until the door at the end has been opened by the final lamp. The next lamp is always visible from the current lamp.

Starting around the second lamp, enemies will begin to spawn. These include a range of melee and ranged foes, starting with "Timeworn Thralls", custom textured baby zombies. "Timeworn Hunters" will appear around lamp 3-4, shooting the player with a bow and arrow. Later, the "Timeworn Executioner" zombies, armed with diamond axes, will also join the fight.

The eighth lamp is on top of a tall circular platform. No normal enemies spawn when activating this lamp, but rather, the **Twilight Envoy** miniboss does. This enemy will remain alive until the player fully activates the lamp, shooting purple dagger projectiles at them. When the progress bar is full, the vault door at the end will dissolve, allowing passage to the innermost sanctum of the Augural Tangle.

North of this final lamp is a pedestal, holding the [[Artifacts#Iker Harvester|Iker Harvester]] artifact.

Through this door, a winding blue stained glass path leads to a purple crystal, housing a tomb that presumably belongs to [[Oriann]]. A chest with the [[Aeongale]] legendary sits opposite this coffin.

The passage out the back of this area leads to an exit, following a stream to the eastern border of Rihelma's Domain with the Lunar Wastes.

## Lore

The Augural Tangle is a massive cavern filled with large crystals, represented in-game by stained glass. These crystals, lore-wise, are said to reflect the visions of the prophetic Star-Rise Drake Rihelma, allowing those without her gift to peer into the unknown times and lands that she sees. Only Rihelma's most trusted are allowed here.
