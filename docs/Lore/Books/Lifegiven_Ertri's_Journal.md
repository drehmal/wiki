### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest at the Lifegiven Hospital in [[Vayniklah's Domain]]. It tells us that when Avsohm reached [[Lo'Dahr]], they brought with them a plague that infected and killed many [[Tehrmari]], known as the Sanguine Corrode (or simply The Corrode), and the Lifegiven at this hospital began to turn them away for fear of contracting the disease themselves.

### Transcription:
> We never should have let those Avsohmic Drehmari heathens establish a foothold within our home. Since they arrived we've been wrought with nothing but disease and turmoil, those terrible people from the disc brought with them the Sanguine Corrode, and long after their disappearance we Tehrmari still feel its effects. We've lost far too many of our people to this terrible blight. It's a sickening rot that causes a grotesque seeping of blood that Lifegiven healing magics can barely contain. Before Avsohm, we were mostly free of deadly disease, but now, this is a harsh reality of Tehrmari life. Out of fear of infection, we reluctantly turn away most patients of the Corrode - an act that breaks the heart of any Lifegiven. Torri was insistent we could save this one, though. She is a newer Lifegiven, still apprenticed and hopeful. She pleaded to take in the poor boy, and her master thought this a good way to teach a lesson. He assigned Torri to the patient, taking every precaution possible to prevent her from being infected. She tried so very hard, but the boy ended up passing two nights ago. She can't bring herself to clean the blood, and none of the rest of us are brave enough to touch that biohazard.

> Damn that Avsohm. Everywhere they went, they brought death. Even their own.
