## Transcription
> The collection of Primal Energy means that we need to upgrade our pipe network significantly. They were able to withstand the trickles of energy we received before, but now that the process is much more efficient, a far more elaborate setup is required. Given that raw energy is extremely hot, a sophisticated cooling system must also be constructed. We must be very careful during the fabrication process as a single leak could turn the entirety of Yavhlix into a crater.
