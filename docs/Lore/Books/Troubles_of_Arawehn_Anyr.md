It is written by a sibling of future Emperor [[Anyr]] shortly after their house was assigned control of the [[Anyr'Nogur]] region. The locals, descended from [[Casai|Casains]] who worship [[Voynahla]], hold a significant distaste for their new Avsohmic superiors, and so Arawehn decides to rename the city to Sal'Anyr and convert the pyramid to the Anyr family mausoleum to encourage assimilation.

## Transcription
> The reception to our noble House taking command in this city has been… muted at best. At worst, it has been downright hostile! I swear, those northerners stare daggers at our backs whenever we turn to leave. If looks could kill, we would have been dead the moment we arrived.
>
> No wonder they are so grim- Sal'Iloh (or Azen'nath as the locals call it) is nothing but a monument to death! From shrines in every home to the great pyramidal Nathus in its core, the Casain make their devotion to Voynahla quite clear. It all sends a chill down my spine.
>
> While my Noble and Ever-So-Almighty Brother Uffeihl is away playing soldier in the far north-east, I will need to find a way to appease the locals. Drehn wouldn’t have wanted us to crack down with energy weapons, even if that would be so much simpler.
>
> Perhaps the Casain can keep their monuments to Voynahla for now, until they discover the wisdom of the Drehuan prophecies. But we will at least need to rename the city. Something far more glorious should commemorate the greatest children of Drahbes! But what?
>
> Ah. Yes. Now I know. The city shall be called Sal’Anyr from now on, and the pyramid will serve as our palace and familial mausoleum. That seems like it will be an acceptable compromise for both sides. It is decided.
