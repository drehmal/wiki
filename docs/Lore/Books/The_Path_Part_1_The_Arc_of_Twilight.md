This book can be found in a chest in a tower in [[Sahd]]. The first of three books in "The Path," this text establishes the concept of the "Arc of Twilight." Fundamentally, this idea relies on the concept of cycles, using the examples of the water cycle and the Torahn rising and setting every day, despite the fact that we can only directly observe part of that cycle. Therefore, there must be an invisible portion of the cycle, an Arc of Twilight, and this applies to the concept of reincarnation as well.

## Transcription
> As creatures blessed with memory, we can see the cycles in nature that the others cannot.
>
> When a rock gibbon or a horse sees water in a spring flow off the falls, into a river, and out to sea, there is no indication that it will return. And yet, when we see the rain, our memories tell us that very water is returning to its lofty perch.
>
> Similarly, when the moons rise and blaze across the horizon, only to set once again, what bee or butterfly of the woods could predict that they will ever rise again? And yet, when the first rays of dawn break the chill of the night, we know that the Torahn will run its course once more.
>
> Moreover, when the great philosophers, magicians, and sages finally breathe their last breath, perhaps their faithful dogs will whine and hang their heads. But we know that their wisdom will once again be reborn in the clear eyes of the infant.
>
> Indeed, our power of memory is great. But it is not all-powerful. While we can intuit the workings of these cycles, we are not permitted to view the transmutations which change the setting Torahn to the rising, or the waters of the ocean to the rain, or the old soul to the new.
>
> Thus, for every arc of the natural cycle we can see modifying the world, there must be a hidden arc of twilight which returns it to its starting point.
