### Transcription:
> Kind Traveler,
>
> Though this sacred flame once burned longer and brighter than any other, it has sadly been extinguished.
>
> But there are still **many other sacred flames burning in Merijool**. If you find one, leave an offering to Lai **beneath**.
>
> Our faith is what stops this land from freezing!
>
> Signed, Pilgrim of the South
