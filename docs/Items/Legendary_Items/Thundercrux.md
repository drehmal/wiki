## Gameplay
Thundercrux is an NBT-modified iron chestplate, inheriting that relatively low durability.

The chestplate is a decent defensive tool, adding Armor and Armor Toughness almost comparable to a vanilla diamond chestplate, with the exception of 2 fewer Armor points. However, it is stronger in an aggressive build, adding attack damage, attack speed, and movement speed.

This is compounded by the chestplate's special ability, Bolt from the Blue. This ability adds an 8% chance on all attacks to deal a critical hit (separate from the jumping critical hits of vanilla Minecraft), dealing double damage on that hit. (1)

1. In version 2.2.1 and before, this critical hit added a +40% damage boost to a hit, which was significantly buffed to a +100% damage increase in 2.2.2.

## How to Obtain
Thundercrux is located in the [[Palaesida's Domain#Heart of the Tempest|Heart of the Tempest]], the large dark stone orb at the center of the storm (not actually moving in-game) in [[Palaesida's Domain]].

The player must navigate up to the Heart through the debris swirling around it, with a small entrance on the north side of the structure. Inside, they will find the draconic skeleton of the deceased Aspect, and at the center of this chamber, a trapped chest containing Thundercrux.

## Lore
Thundercrux belonged to Amohn Aihura, a La'Tehrmari hero revered for his heroics during the [[Divine Schism]], fighting alongside the Palaesidans. Amohn is mentioned in at least three other places, including the book [[Notice of Punishment]], which outlines his killer's punishment, as well as Awe, an axe belonging to him which can be found in his hidden underground grave along the eastern edge of Palaesida's Domain.

Thundercrux is also found in a very lore-relevant location, as the Heart of the Tempest is the final resting place of [[Palaesida]] himself. The Aspect died in the Divine Schism, with Amohn dying with him, and the Aspect's bones were laid to rest in his domain, only for them to partially reanimate and conjure an eternal storm throughout his domain.
