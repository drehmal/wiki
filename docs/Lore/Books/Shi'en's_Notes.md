> Ugh, another failure. I just don't know why these corpses aren't co-operating! At this point I've tried so many techniques I can barely remember what I was trying to do in the first place. Dismemberment, trepanning, application of poison, ingestion of toxin, freezing, sensory deprivation... It all just leads to death. I am convinced that this is a fools errand, and that there truly is no mortal path to the greatness of Virmari.
