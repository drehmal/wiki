The **Tidal War** was a conflict fought in the mid-late Third Avihm, sparked by the death of the [[Tide Queen]] in Av3 628.

After the Tide Queen's death, the [[Tidal Dynasty]] collapsed, and two forces were left to fight for control of the [[Black Jungle]] in the new power vacuum: the Grand Parish of [[Virtuo]], who was backed by [[Insohm]], and the Tide Queen's remaining military officials.

The war ended after [[Maelihs]] took advantage of the chaos in the region to invade the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] and badly wound the Goddess, ripping one of her eyes from its socket. However, he refused to kill her, and returned to the far southwest with the eye as a trophy, shocking the Drehmari population.

This attack on Virtuo reinvigorated the population in her favor, and the Parish declared themselves the rightful rulers of the Kiln and its surrounding lands, granting Insohm a new member state: the Parochial Enclave of Firteid.
