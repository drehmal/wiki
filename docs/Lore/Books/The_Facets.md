# The Facets

## Extra Warning

!!! danger "Despite being found in the late game and not the end-game, any substantive discussion around these books will necessarily delve into end-game spoilers. Even if you have found these books in your playthrough, it is still strongly recommended that you do not read this article unless you have already reached the true end of the map, as described above."

The Facets are a collection of seven (7) signed, written (non-editable) books found in [[Lo'Dahr]] through the [[Syzygy]] questline. The first six facets are all awarded after completing one of the six trials on the moon, and the seventh is awarded at the final location the player is guided towards after completing all of the trials.

The facets are written as verses of scripture, containing apocalyptic prophecies foreseen by [[Rihelma]].

The exact meaning behind these books is not 100% confirmed, but the widely accepted interpretation within the community is that each individual Facet describes what would happen if one of the characters in the Drehmal universe were to complete [[The Ambition]], effectively becoming the ultimate ruler of all existence.

Under this interpretation, each respective text portrays what may ultimately happen to the realm of Drehmal under their new ruler.

## Facet I ([[Khive]]'s Trial)

## Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| -761  |  98   | -788  |

## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest at the [[Mystic Gallery]], upon completion of the trial at that location.

It is believed to be a description of a hypothetical world in which [[Aok]], the First Necromancer, completes the Ambition. In this timeline, Aok gains supreme power over the [[Aspects]], with particular focus on his killing of Khive, the Aspect of Magic whom Aok is implied to have betrayed. Aok calls upon an army of the dead to wage his war against the Aspects, and ultimately wins, causing all to collapse into one.

## Transcription
> 1:1 - His maw is wide, his teeth are many. Of the wicked, he is the most profaned.
>
> 1:2 - And the Mystic Elder shall lie at his feet, viscous ichor dripping from their neck. All will fear him.
>
> 1:3 - In the final days he shall gather each first-born child and their cries will echo the world. No more children shall be born breathing.
>
> 1:4 - He will walk the graves, bringing forth marionettes to fuel his ambition. All color will be drained where he steps.
>
> 1:5 - On the final day he will tap the Tree, and drink its sap. It will blacken and rot, and the Aspects will grow utterly powerless.
>
> 1:6 - And all shall collapse into one.

## Facet II

## Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1125  |  83   | 1069  |

## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Star-Rise Orrery]], upon completion of the trial at that location.

It is not clear exactly whose possible future this text refers to, and in fact, it may be the only facet that is not an unfulfilled future. This facet has clear parallels to the fall of [[Empire of Avsohm|Avsohm]], from the perfectly circular creatures known as Those Beyond to accounts of a golden eye manifesting in the sky, punishing the seekers of forbidden knowledge.

## Transcription
> 2:1 - The sky will blacken and shadows will grow longer than ever before. Tendrils of dark will seep into every corner of the world, grasping at forbidden knowledge.
>
> 2:2 - And Those Beyond will enter, perfect and circular. They will devour all in their path. They will, even consume themselves.
>
> 2:3 - For one day and one night, a golden oculus dripping with blackness will grace the very sky. It will not be a creation of the Star-Rise Drake. It will see all, and all will see it.
>
> 2:4 - The Blasphemous Eye will havoc the world, scorching and abducting every last opposer.
>
> 2:5 - When the Eye closes, so too will the eyes of all who have witnessed it for three days and three nights. They will think it all a distant dream.
>
> 2:6 - And the interlopers will be no longer.

## Facet III ([[Nahyn]]'s Trial)

## Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  530  |  123  |  15   |

## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Hypogean Labyrinth]], upon completion of the trial at that location.

Due to the repeated references to silence in this facet, it has been posited that this is the timeline in which the nearly unmentioned [[Verrhys]], Aspect of Silence, completes the Ambition and brings the realm to a state of total silence and peace. This can be supported by the fact that Lahrs, an aspect often referred to as the counterpart to Verrhys, is the presumptive subject of Facet VI.

## Transcription
> 3:1 - Silence will creep into every corner of the realm. It will be a quiet and peaceful passing.
>
> 3:2 - We will drift to the apex, moons will shatter and sable crystals shall grow up from the very roots.
>
> 3:3 - The last day is near, and they will finally awaken for its passing. They will rot, leaving behind miles of bone. They will be at peace.
>
> 3:4 - The sky shall weep as the realm is consumed. Pale sands shall sweep through everything, forming vast dunes across the disc.
>
> 3:5 - One being shall stand alone to observe the end. They will be offered closure.
>
> 3:6 - And silence will spread its wings.

## Facet IV ([[Dahr]]'s Trial)

## Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
|  198  |  18   | 1177  |

## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in [[Abyssal Rise]], upon completion of the trial at that location.

It is believed to be a description of a hypothetical world in which [[Maelihs]] completes the Ambition, conquering the realm and bathing it in fire before he, too, is consumed by sorrow and flame, and nothing but ash remains.

## Transcription
> 4:1 - He shall ride at the helm of a maelstrom host as the warhorn sounds in the plains. Outriders will clash with weakened militias, and their corpses will be consumed.
>
> 4:2 - Nations will be flooded with liquid fire, and flesh will char into slurry. It will fuel his forges.
>
> 4:3 - The carrion birds shall be crushed into the exposed ribs of the fallen.
>
> 4:4 -  The survivors kneel as the firestorm builds, a congregation to conflagration.
>
> 4:5 -  His vengeful face shall melt into sorrow, as he tries to hold his eyes in place.
>
> 4:6 -  Only ash shall color the world’s rocky bones.

## Facet V ([[Lai]]'s Trial)

## Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1108  |  70   | -1198 |

## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Brightwyrm's Calderium]], upon completion of the trial at that location.

Its text appears to represent the timeline in which [[Virtuo]] achieves the Ambition, and molds the realm into her idea of true perfection, entirely symmetrical and in perfect order. In this scenario, she assumes complete control over the Aspects and rules as the strongest part of a perfect triumvirate, until eventually the "dark wind" blows and brings decay to this beautiful world. This may be a reference to Those Beyond or [[The Nothing]] at large, furthering the ties between Virtuo, [[Eastern Xivrhynt]], and the Nothing.

## Transcription
> 5:1 - She will walk the copse, and the ancient trees shall stand at attention.
>
> 5:2 - Humming in resonance, the Aspects themselves shall kneel before her.
>
> 5:3 - A triumvirate of perfect order shall weave flesh into shining steel.
>
> 5:4 - The continents will smooth into perfect symmetry. Mountain will face mountain, and tree will match tree.
>
> 5:5 - Hardening and coalescing, the realm shall meld into one shimmering whole. Her elation will be overwhelming.
>
> 5:6 - The dark wind will blow, leaving beauty to decay.

## Facet VI ([[Vayniklah]]'s Trial)

## Coordinates (After Trial):
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| -485  |  74   | -222  |

## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest at the [[Temple of Life]], upon completion of the trial at that location.

It is believed that this book represents a reality in which [[Lahrs]], Aspect of Resonance, completes the Ambition. Lahrs, a very mysterious Aspect that is seldom mentioned but seems to be integral to the fundamental concept of balance within the world of Drehmal, has one of the more positive spins on the realm's end. In this timeline, a cyclical form of balance is thoroughly restored to the realm, with eternal life being granted to all and with all conflict seemingly ending due to the total elimination of "the malevolent."

## Transcription
> 6:1 - From the soil shall sprout new life, and Meadows will walk once more.
>
> 6:2 - Souls will cease being stolen, existence eternal granted to all. In eternality, the skies shall be one.
>
> 6:3 - We will dance together, circling cycles as wondrous music serenades our souls.
>
> 6:4 - Brother will forgive brother and sister shall embrace sister. Parents shall rejoice with their children, as all born for the rest of time will know only peace and bliss.
>
> 6:5 - The malevolent will never walk the soil again.
>
> 6:6 - And resonance shall swallow silence.

## Facet VII

## Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1923  |  25   | 1865  |

## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest at [[Yriel's Tomb]], far to the southeast of the rest of the inhabitable portion of Lo'Dahr. This area is only accessible after completing all six trials tied to the previous six facets, and the player is rewarded at this location with the [[Syzygy]] mythical weapon. The book lies in a chest behind the weapon.

The final facet seems to be Rihelma's prophecy for what would happen to the world if the player were to succeed in the Ambition. In this timeline, "children of quartz and glass" awaken, likely referring to the resurrection of Avsohm (figuratively and/or literally through the resurrection of important figures and rebuilding of its ruins). They proceed to take "the treasures of the tomb," likely referring to the [[Mythbreaker]], successfully using it to tear through and peer beyond the Veil. This ends on a positive note: "millions of flowers will bloom like golden sand on a placid seashore" may refer to the fulfillment of [[Anyr]]'s goal of conquering and ruling over all of existence as a god-emperor, or it may be something else.

## Transcription
> 7:1 - Children of quartz and glass shall awaken, removing the cord that attaches them to the corpse of their hideous mother.
>
> 7:2 - Mewling and gnashing, they will be fed by the rays of a dying Torahn in the crimson sky.
>
> 7.3 - Crawling unsupervised, their shins shall be stained by the mud of their ancestors.
>
> 7:4 - Lifted by wing and claw, they will grow in six bursts until their feet drag on the ground and their toes take root in the soil.
>
> 7:5 - Given the treasures of the tomb, they will take aim and fire. A bolt of devastation echoes in birdsong.
>
> 7:6 - A family reunited, and around them millions of flowers will bloom like golden sand on a placid seashore.
