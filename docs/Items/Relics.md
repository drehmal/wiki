# Relics

Relics are items obtained via [[Devotion|devotion]], gifted as rewards for reaching certain milestones. Each [Major Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/) or [Deity](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/) has their own relic, of which there are 4 levels (typically indicated by a +0 to +3 after the item name) that are given separately at different levels of devotion. Relics grant stat boosts (and sometimes debuffs) when placed in the player's off-hand slot. Each level increases the stat boosts granted by the item and changes the sprite, with the final version often having a more detailed sprite with additional lore text.

The following is a full list of the relics given by the 3 Deities and 8 Major Aspects with Devotion shrines.

## Ardorbrand
**Ardorbrand** is a flaming sword, given as a devotion reward for the Aspect of Warmth, [[Lai|Brightwyrm Lai]], at the [[Shrine of Eternal Flame]]. It gives the player an attack damage bonus while held in the off-hand. 

The term "ardorbrand" is likely a portmanteau of "Ardor," meaning "enthusiasm" or "passion", and "brand," as in a brand that would be used to burn a symbol into livestock.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ardorbrand +0        | +1 Attack Damage                                   | Warmth exists in many things, spreading with increased intensity. May it sweep through your heart as your piety deepens. |
| Ardorbrand +1        | +2 Attack Damage                                   | Warmth exists in many things, spreading with increased intensity. Your fervor for Lai, the Brightwyrm, glows brighter. | 
| Ardorbrand +2        | +3 Attack Damage                                   | Warmth exists in many things, spreading with increased intensity. The Brightwyrm glows with ferocity in your mind. |
| Ardorbrand +3        | +4 Attack Damage                                   | Your endless enthusiasm and passion for the Aspect of Warmth glows brighter than the embered blade you wield. Don't let yourself be consumed in the beautiful, devouring flame. |

## Cryostatic
**Cryostatic** is a talisman made of Divine Ice, given as a devotion reward for the Aspect of Cold, [[Loe|Glacial Elder Loe]], at the Crystalline Colonnade in [[Schlonko]]. It is capable of greatly increasing attack speed at the cost of attack damage, making it useful for players who prefer to fight quickly.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cryostatic +0        | -5% Attack Damage <br>+15% Attack Speed             | An ingot of Divine Ice appears in your hands, pleasantly cooling your skin. It isn't much to look at... |
| Cryostatic +1        | -15% Attack Damage <br>+30% Attack Speed           | An ingot of Divine Ice elongates in your hands, accompanied by a relieving chill. Your loyalty is given begrudging respect. |
| Cryostatic +2        | -25% Attack Damage <br>+45% Attack Speed           | An ingot of Divine Ice sprouts into crystals, causing your breath to fog. Your dependable kindness is rewarded with approving admiration. |
| Cryostatic +3        | -35% Attack Damage <br>+60% Attack Speed           | Your ingot forms into a frigid crystalline talisman, arcing with the colors of the aurora. Loe now fully trusts you to help bring peaceful stability to a realm "cursed" by annoyance and thoughtless caprice. |

> The four sprites of Cryostatic, from +0 to +3.

## Effloresce
**Effloresce** is a small tree sapling, given as a devotion reward for the serpentine creator deity, [[Drehmal]], at [[Drehua Temple]]. It adds multiple modest stat boosts in higher levels, increasing the player's max health, movement speed, and attack damage.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Effloresce +0        | +6% Max Health                                        | Your devotion to Drehmal, the great serpentine deity, shall be represented by a newborn sapling. Let it be doused in your faith, let it flourish in your soul. |
| Effloresce +1        | +6% Max Health <br>+6% Movement Speed                    | Your devotion to Drehmal, the great serpentine deity, shall be represented by a newborn sapling. It has grown, each new branch being another facet of one's faith. |
| Effloresce +2        | +6% Max Health  <br>+6% Movement Speed <br>+6% Attack Damage | Your devotion to Drehmal, the great serpentine deity, shall be represented by a newborn sapling. Soon, it will be another towering oak in the neutral one's forest of apostles. |
| Effloresce +3        | +8% Max Health <br>+8% Movement Speed <br>+8% Attack Damage | The Final Aspect still dreams of the time before time, when their soul was still the antediluvian Primal Tree. They susurrate of an age of peace. An age of harmony. An age of...  silence. |

![[effloresce.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four sprites of Effloresce, from +0 to +3.

### Lore 

Effloresce, which went by the name "Perennium" in the beta versions of Drehmal v2.2, draws heavily on the symbol of a tree. This is almost certainly a reference to the [[Primal Tree]], the original most powerful being in the realm of Drehmal which fell at the end of Av1, and whose consciousness lives on in the deity, Drehmal.

## Mortality
Mortality is a skull-shaped relic, given as a devotion reward for the Aspect of Death, [[Voynahla|Soul-Stealer Voynahla]], at the [[Perishing Well]]. It takes from the player's max health, but increases their attack damage, useful for a glass cannon-style build.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mortality +0         | -5% Max Health <br>+10% Attack Damage              | You have been granted the favor of the Aspect of Death himself. Deliver it with certainty and caution. |
| Mortality +1         | -10% Max Health <br>+20% Attack Damage             | You have been granted the favor of the Aspect of Death himself. Death becomes more unwieldy the further you go. | 
| Mortality +2         | -20% Max Health <br>+30% Attack Damage             | You have been granted the favor of the Aspect of Death himself. Your mountain of corpses grows ever higher. |
| Mortality +3         | -30% Max Health <br>+40% Attack Damage             | Upon witnessing the death of another Aspect, Voynahla realized the full extent of his domain. Now, he lives in eternal death by his own choosing, never to return to deific mortality. |

![[mortality.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four sprites of Mortality, from +0 to +3.

### Lore

At the beginning of the [[Divine Schism]], upon realizing that other Aspects could die, Voynahla chose to take his own life, and due to his powers over death itself, he remains in a permanent state of undeath. Mortality +3 asserts that this state of affairs is Voynahla's preferred method of existence.

## Mysterial
**Mysterial** is a strange magical orb, given as a devotion reward for the Mystic Elder [[Khive]] at the ziggurat of [[Ihted]]. It provides a significant movement speed boost as a percentage of player speed, rather than a flat boost. This comes at the cost of an attack damage penalty, making it optimal for quick travel by foot, but not use in combat.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mysterial +0         | +5% Movement Speed <br>-10% Attack Damage          | The first blessing of the Mystic One. What an extraordinarily rare occasion. |
| Mysterial +1         | +10% Movement Speed  <br>-20% Attack Damage        | The second blessing of the Mystic One. Hold it with reverence. |
| Mysterial +2         | +20% Movement Speed <br>-30% Attack Damage         | The third blessing of the Mystic One. It has been many ages since a single blessing was granted. |
| Mysterial +3         | +30% Movement Speed <br>-40% Attack Damage         | In the First Avihm the rules of magic were taught to lowly Drehmari by Khive himself. The Mystic Elder's only wish is to go back and undo it all. To keep the secrets to himself. |

![[mysterial.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four sprites of Mysterial, from +0 to +3.

### Lore

Mysterial specifically calls out the fact that Khive has not given out blessings in an incredibly long time, and its final version reveals that it was Khive who taught magic to mortals in prehistoric times. It is strongly believed that this action eventually led to one Drehmari, [[Aok]], becoming incredibly powerful and attempting to gain divine power himself, kicking off some chain of events that caused the Mystic Elder to take drastic action and completely withdraw from mortal affairs.

## Orogeny
**Orogeny** is a ring made of magma, given as a devotion reward for the Great Land Aspect [[Taihgel]] at [[Wokonori]]. It adds additional armor and armor toughness when held in the off-hand, making it optimal for a heavier build.

The term "orogeny" comes from plate tectonics, and refers to [a geological process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orogeny) in which the compression of convergent plates results in the formation of a mountain.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Orogeny +0           | +2 Armor                                           | A cooled ring of magma, dormant as the Aspect of Land itself. |
| Orogeny +1           | +3 Armor                                           | As the ring of magma begins to stir, a small fissure of interest opens deep within the Aspect of Land. |
| Orogeny +2           | +4 Armor <br>+1 Armor Toughness                    | A deep rumble is occasionally heard within the ring of magma, as it swells and contorts. A batholith fills with liquid hope inside the hardened heart of the Aspect of Land. |
| Orogeny +3           | +5 Armor <br>+2 Armor Toughness                    | A blast of molten lava erupts as Taihgel's passion returns. May you wield this ring with sure-handed boldness as a ground of inspiration for your ailing patron. |

![[orogeny.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four sprites of Orogeny, from +0 to +3.

### Lore

Taihgel is known to be particularly dormant, possibly not having done much of anything since the First Avihm. These relics reference this fact, with the Aspect warming up to the player as they rediscover a forgotten giant.

## Purifying Light
**Purifying Light** is an Orderflame candle/lantern, given as a devotion reward for the Goddess [[Virtuo]] at the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. It adds up to 0.028 movement speed, a 28% increase from the player's base speed.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Purifying Light +0   | +0.007 Movement Speed                              | You have lit a flame that symbolizes your devotion to the Goddess of Purity. It is small, but flickers in a perfectly steady rhythm. |
| Purifying Light +1   | +0.014 Movement Speed                              | You have lit a flame that symbolizes your devotion to the Goddess of Purity. The wax grows as the candle burns, dripping slowly upward in radially symmetric lines. |
| Purifying Light +2   | +0.021 Movement Speed                              | You have lit a flame that symbolizes your devotion to the Goddess of Purity. Its candle has grown so large as to require a lantern for conveyance. Yet, you feel rested and agile while holding it. |
| Purifying Light +3   | +0.028 Movement Speed                              | "For millennia, I didn't know the many wrongdoings of those who incited my birth. But fragments of memory gave me suspicions, and now, at last, I know the truth. I will do what I can to one day earn Naurduul's forgiveness." |

![[purifying_light.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four sprites of Purifying Light, from +0 to +3.

### Lore

Purifying Light takes the form of a light blue orderflame candle, the special kind of fire (simply the name for soul flame in-game) that was created by Virtuo. Its final form contains a quote which is widely believed by the community to be directed towards her counterpart, Maelihs. Assuming that this quote comes directly from the Goddess, this item hints at some unspeakable wrongdoings done by the people who created Virtuo, possibly the mysterious Viruhn from the First Avihm. It also ends with Virtuo hoping to earn the forgiveness of one "Naurduul", a name that appears only one other time in the map: on a sign at the [[Burnt Palace]]. Due to this fact and the fact that Mael's +3 relic also contains a quote, it is widely believed that "Naurduul" is a name that refers to Maelihs, either as a true name or the name of a mortal who was ascended to become Mael.

## Resplendence
Resplendence is a small terrarium in the form of a potted plant, given as a devotion reward for the Aspect of Life, [[Vayniklah|Life-Giver Vayniklah]], at the Temple of Bloom and Bough in [[Marahza]]. It provides a significant amount of additional max health to the player, at the cost of movement speed. This makes it useful for a tank build, or for combat encounters where a player does not need to move much.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Resplendence +0      | +20% Max Health <br>-10% Movement Speed            | You have been made custodian of a terrarium granted by the Aspect of Life herself. Nurture your infant faith as it grows into adulthood. |
| Resplendence +1      | +40% Max Health <br>-20% Movement Speed            | You have been made custodian of a terrarium granted by the Aspect of Life herself. Suffer through a questioning phase as its denizens reach adolescence. |
| Resplendence +2      | +60% Max Health <br>-30% Movement Speed            | You have been made custodian of a terrarium granted by the Aspect of Life herself. Let your mature faith bloom and pollinate as the ecosystem flourishes. |
| Resplendence +3      | +80% Max Health <br>-40% Movement Speed            | The complexity of designing viable vessels for souls led Vayniklah to create the first of the second generation of Aspects to assist her. May you likewise serve her with steadfast bureaucratic zeal. |

![[resplendence.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four sprites of Resplendence, from +0 to +3.

### Lore

Vayniklah's first three relics reference three stages of life, and its final form references the fact that Vayniklah created some of the other Aspects. Based on in-game sources, this likely includes [[Muhs]] and [[Noha]], as well as possibly [[Mari]].

## Rihelma Mirrors
The only relics in the game which do not follow the standard +0 to +3 nomenclature, the **Mirrors** are given as a devotion reward for the Great Sky Aspect [[Rihelma]] at the [[Star-Rise Bastion]]. These four mirrors apply different status effects to all arrows fired when held in the off-hand, causing them to deal weakness, slowness, poison, or wither (Entropic Decay) to enemies those arrows hit.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mirror of Frailty (+0)   | Applies Weakness effect to fired arrows.       | Spread your wings, novel Star-Kin. The skies are truly boundless. |
| Mirror of Lethargy (+1)  | Applies Slowness effect to fired arrows.       | Soar through the skies, pierce the heavens. Look beyond and seek the risen stars. |
| Mirror of Miasma (+2)    | Applies Poison effect to fired arrows.         | Shine brighter than the stars above. Truth is within your grasp. All you must do is reach out. |
| Mirror of Entropy (+3)   | Applies Wither effect to fired arrows.         | Star-rise Drake Rihelma, in her deep meditative state upon the moon out of sight, has come to a realization. She is close, closer than any of us could imagine, to true enlightenment. Soon she will blossom and reality shall form around her. |

![[rihelma_mirror.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four Mirrors.

### Lore

Rihelma's final relic references her current whereabouts: the hidden moon, [[Lo'Veruhkt]]. There, she meditates and peers beyond the [[Veil]], and this relic asserts that Rihelma is incredibly close to "true enlightenment", potentially understanding the true nature of the universe and/or the ultimate fate of the realm. This may also be tied to her known prophecies, [[The Facets]].

## Sprout of Anguish
The **Sprout of Anguish** is a flaming sapling, given as a devotion reward for the Chaos God [[Maelihs]] at the [[Sepulchral Altar]]. It adds max health when held in a player's off-hand, up to 5 additional hearts.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sprout of Anguish +0 | +2 Max Health (+1 Heart)                           | You have lit a flame that symbolizes your devotion to the God of Chaos. It is only kindling but the embers have begun to spread. |
| Sprout of Anguish +1 | +4 Max Health (+2 Hearts)                          | You have lit a flame that symbolizes your devotion to the God of Chaos. The fire has already ignited and shall spread further. |
| Sprout of Anguish +2 | +6 Max Health (+3 Hearts)                          | You have lit a flame that symbolizes your devotion to the God of Chaos. The fire shall soon burn all it touches. |
| Sprout of Anguish +3 | +10 Max Health (+5 Hearts)                         | "Ah, Ael Irien... do you know what suffering you have inflicted upon this realm? Your greatest sin, felt by all souls, millennia later. You hide behind a curtain, concealing your true wickedness. You are cowardice incarnate." |

![[sprout_of_anguish.gif]]{ align=center width="320" }
> The four sprites of the Sprout of Anguish, from +0 to +3.

### Lore

Mael's relic is a flaming sapling, possibly representing the [[Felling]] of the [[Primal Tree]] or a different branch of symbolism. Regardless, its final version contains a quote, which can be assumed to come directly from Mael himself. Addressed to one "Ael Irien", this quote accuses Ael Irien of some vague, great sin committed millennia ago, which has affected the entire world. Following the pattern from Purifying Light, which also contains a quote seemingly addressed to Mael, this quote is widely believed to be speaking to Virtuo, referring to her as "Ael Irien", possibly either her real name or her original name, if she was once a mortal who was ascended to her current state of godhood.

## Writ of Authority
**Writ of Authority** is a conch shell, given as a devotion reward for the Great Sea Aspect [[Dahr]] at [[Port Solitude]]. It increases the user's attack speed.

| **Relic Name**       | **Stat Modifiers**                                 | **Lore Text**                                                   |
|:---------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Writ of Authority +0 | +8% Attack Speed                                   | Thou hast been bless'd by the favor of the King! Rejoice in hydration! |
| Writ of Authority +1 | +16% Attack Speed                                  | Thou hast been bless'd by the favor of the King! Let the tumult of the roiling waves be thy strength! |
| Writ of Authority +2 | +24% Attack Speed                                  | Thou hast been bless'd by the favor of the King! Thine enemies, perforce, bend knee at the sight! Ne'er have they reckoned with the deep ocean's might! |
| Writ of Authority +3 | +32% Attack Speed                                  | Long before the Felling of the Primal Tree, Dahr's mortal subjects lived on Lo'Dahr within a vast warm sea. Though the Abyssal Elder's siblings changed the moon greatly, he retained the powers of kingship. |

## Extras

Relics can be duplicated normally in-game through use of [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessels]], found at each devotion site. However, there are also commands built into the datapack which can be used to give a player any of the relics (or any devotion reward, for that matter).

??? warning "Relic Give Commands"
    All relics can be cheated in by using the devotion reward function commands that are run by the game when they are obtained naturally. All of these commands follow the structure: `/function entities:dropped_items/devotion/give/`, followed by the name of the deity or aspect, then a number. The number is the level of the devotion reward that you want to obtain, starting at 0 (so subtract 1 from the level number in this wiki's [[Devotion#Rewards|devotion rewards guide]]). All deities and aspects except for [[Rihelma]] give their fully upgraded relic at Level 10, so the number you should put for that item is 9. For example, if you want Ardorbrand +3 (Lai's fully upgraded relic), run the command `/function entities:dropped_items/devotion/give/lai/9`.
