??? note "2.2.2 Addition"
    This book was added in the 2.2.2 update, and is not present in prior versions of the map.

This book is found in the [[Aphelion]], in a chest in room A5. It is the journal of a homesick member of the ship's crew, burnt out from the high expectations imposed by Anyr and wishing to see her parents on the disc again.

## Transcription

> The view may be nice, and the spectacle of it all may be breathtaking every time I look out at the windows and see the entire world, be[^1] able to pinpoint the area I lived in all the way up here... <br>
> I miss Mom and Dad. I've been working so very hard these past months, Emperor Anyr is hellbent on getting the tasks he wants done and if that means working us to the pure bone and antlers then I guess that's just how it is.
>
> I work everyday, from start of shift to end of shift with nothing much past a 30 minute break. 12 hours. <br>
> And I'm exhausted, my mind weary, so I go to sleep. I can't spend time with any of my friends here. I've accidentally slept in so many times, and Kahl has had to wake me up multiple times. Sometimes I haven't put on my uniform proper, which I know gets on the Emperor's nerves.
> 
> Maybe if I wasn't worked so hard I would be able to function properly. I would love to take a vacation back to Drehmal, see my Mom and Dad.
>
> Ah well, enough complaining. I have to get back to work... come on Azurite...just keep working... keep going... Dad said I'll do great things... and I intend to do that...
