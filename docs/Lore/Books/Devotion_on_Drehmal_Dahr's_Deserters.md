## Transcription
> You can find Dahr worshippers wherever the land meets the sea, but the most fascinating group has to be the one that makes its home on the south coast of mainland Mael's Desolation. A solitary town is perched there on the cratered shore, one of the few inhabited places anywhere nearby since the area was part of the Heartwood centuries ago. Apparently, the town's priests do an excellent job of spreading the worship of Dahr to sailors who stop through for repairs or rest along the Southern Exchange.
