## Transcription
> Aaaah. I’m so happy now that I’m writing down my sighs! It took a lotta years of work to build the meat factory to what it was.
Now that it’s sold and my tower’s built, nobody can touch me. They’ve got people living in there now, begging for help, and watching the old place
fall apart around themselves. Not my problem! I’ve earned the right to the best view in town. Maybe I’ll get a few good years to finally write that book I’ve been planning…
