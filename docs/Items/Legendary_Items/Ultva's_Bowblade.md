## Gameplay
Ultva's Bowblade is an NBT-modified bow.

The bowblade encourages a fluid, dynamic melee/ranged build, granting a movement speed boost, carrying the same base melee stats (attack damage/speed) as a vanilla diamond sword, and having the same base damage as a vanilla bow, with the possibility for regular sword and bow enchantments.

The weapon's ability, Reversal, is activated when the bow is used for a melee kill. This plays a sound effect and adds fire particles to the bow and player for approximately 5 seconds. During this time, any arrows fired by the bow will deal an additional 4 damage, and will have a piercing effect, passing through and damaging unlimited enemies. This ability can be very useful when dealing with large crowds of weaker enemies, as the enhanced arrow is capable of passing through and dealing significant damage to large groups.

## How to Obtain
Ultva's Bowblade is located in the [[Casai]] region, in the vault where Ultva himself went insane.

This vault, the [[Last Avsohmic Vault]], is located on a small island off the western coast of Casai. Once on the island, the vault's door can simply be broken down, and there is only one custom enemy—a Lost Avsohmic Soldier—present in the vault. The bowblade is found in a trapped chest at the back of this vault.

## Lore
Ultva's Bowblade was the weapon of choice for its namesake, [[Ultva|Ultva Utofal]]. Ultva, one of the co-founders of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], went mad inside of the very vault where this item is found, attempting to rediscover the lost secrets of [[Avsohm]] and coming tantalizingly close before losing his mind.
