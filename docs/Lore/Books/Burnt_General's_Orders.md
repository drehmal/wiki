## Transcription
> I, Tevus, the Second General, have been stationed at the Burnt Palace to ensure everything is in order. I am to stay here until Rhalon reports back on her findings.
>
> Ethgar, the Third General, is stationed at the Sepulchral Altar in Rhaveloth. I hope all is well, as the general populous of that dismal place do not hold the generals, or any authority for that matter, in high regard.
>
> Rhalon, the First General and our current superior in Maelihs's absence, has taken a small battalion of Maelmari out to Spearhead in search of Insohmic secrets. It seems like a dangerous mission but Rhalon is without a doubt the most proficient warrior in this palace... besides Maelihs himself, of course.
