## Transcription
> In the old land of Casai, southwest of a frozen Avsohmic tower, lies a ruined bridge that seemingly leads into a tall butte. After much difficulty, I managed to climb up to far end. There, within the catacomb-temple, I met a solitary monk from the Children of Voynahla. When I asked about the condition of the bridge, her grim answer humored me: "Fixing it would be like smearing makeup on a corpse. We all must fall apart sometime."
