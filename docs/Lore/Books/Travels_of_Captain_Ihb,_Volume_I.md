## Transcription
> In the fjords of Palisades Heath lies a devious society of pirates. A tenacious lot before all else; even the rise of Avsohm was not enough to dislodge them from their lofty perches amongst the cliffs. They raid, pillage, and steal all across the coast of the Mouth of Drehmal.
>
> That is where my story begins. I am Captain Ihb, the greatest pirate in the Realm! I was born in a secluded town in the Heartwood, built by humble forest people. But I knew from a young age the forest was not my home! I travelled west, and took to the sea at a young age.
>
> My goal? To eliminate the pirates in Palisades Heath, and claim their treasure for myself! The many broadside cannons of my glorious ship demolished the entire outpost, and left nothing behind. Their treasure was mine! The first success of many for the glorious Captain Ihb!
