**Avsohm'Kohl** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The only variant of the Minecraft elytra found in the Drehmal map, Avsohm'Kohl is found during the 25% completion event at [[Sal'Mevir]]. It is somewhat slower than a vanilla elytra, having custom mechanics that restrict the player from using it to actively fly using firework rockets or riptide-enchanted tridents.

| **Lore**                      | A strange technological artifact gifted by avSYS, constructed by the brilliant scientists housed here thousands of years ago. Despite the cutting edge technology used in its construction, its weaknesses are hard to ignore, mainly being prone to combustion and an aversion to water-based magics. |

## Gameplay
Avsohm'Kohl is similar to a vanilla elytra, being a pair of wings that are equipped in the Body armor slot and allow the player to glide or fly. However, Avsohm'Kohl gives the player the Slow Falling status effect while active, causing the player to glide much more slowly than a vanilla pair of wings would, unless substantial momentum is built up first. The wings are also incompatible with common methods used to make elytras faster, as the ability to do so could trivialize exploration of the continent.

Attempting to use firework rockets while gliding will give the message "Your glider catches fire...," failing to propel the player forward and lighting them on fire.

Even holding a trident enchanted with Riptide while wearing Avsohm'Kohl will instantly begin to deal damage to the player, with the message "The trident's arcana conflicts with your glider..."

Avsohm'Kohl is therefore best utilized for gliding short distances between nearby points. Substantial speed can be built up if the player falls from a significant height before activating the glider.

## How to Obtain
Avsohm'Kohl is located inside of a chest behind a stained glass pane in the final tower at [[Sal'Mevir]], at its highest room, which opens up upon player approach. This room is accessed by completion of the Temporal Engine puzzle at Sal'Mevir (see [[Sal'Mevir#Gameplay|Sal'Mevir Gameplay]]).

## Lore
Avsohm'Kohl was created by an [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] researcher named Koen, stationed at Sal'Mevir. Its name is a portmanteau of "Avsohm" and "Kohlohmah", the latter being gigantic vulture-like creatures that inhabited the [[Anyr'Nogur]] desert and were tamed by some of the people in that region, even used in battle.

## Extras
While not exactly an intended mechanic for regular Drehmal exploration, Avsohm'Kohl's limitations do not prevent knockback-boosting. Therefore, a second player equipped with an item that has high knockback (such as [[Peace Treaty]]) may launch gliding players forward, or a single player can utilize the Sharksbane artifact can bowboost themselves.
