# Minor Ruins

Not all ruins in Drehmal are created equal. While some, along the likes of [[Caer Adacia]] or [[Xor'Huul]], are major locations with story significance and very rare loot, many others are more simple. 

The locations in this folder can be thought of as more straightforward ruins. They may have an [[Artifacts|artifact]] or even two and a lore book, but they don't contain any massive sprawling dungeons or integral lore implications.
