## Transcription
> Not many of my kind have ventured so far north in recent times. What a joy it is to be in Merijool, where one can sleep beneath the warmth of a sacred flame. I wonder what Flamestoker Ghulak would think of me now!
>
> I cannot say that he would be happy to hear just how far I have ventured beyond the walls of my brethren. But after I saw this place in the sacred flames back home, I knew I had to make the journey.
>
> I am leaving behind my camping materials as an offering to the Brightwyrm. Traveler, feel free to use them to rest your head.
>
> -Pilgrim of the South
