 

This book can be found in a chest in the dark green building (Ehrmion's Home) in [[Dusps]]. It describes a cornflower blooming early and seeming to establish a psychic hold over the author, who becomes obsessed with maintaining it. It has the exact same contents as [[Growing Fear]], with the exception of uncapitalized month abbreviations.

## Transcription
> virma. 17 <br>
> A lone cornflower bloomed earlier than most this year, the rest still budded as summer isn't quite upon us. My volunteer, Deoan, recommended I trim it for the sake of consistency, and they have a better eye for presentation than me.

> I’ve had to keep rolling the compost bins more as heat grows on the plateau, but as Deoan is not used to the practice yet, they left a clamp slack on the lid and the contents spilled on the pathway. What struck me more was the appearance of a cornflower, still crisp and unmatted. It felt warm, not like that of the decomposing flora, but sunkissed and alive.

> Deoan mentioned just beheading the thing, but something in me aches at the thought. Even grasping the shears near it sends me into a tizzy. I’ve had to set them in charge for the time being as I don’t think I’m fit for it right now. I swear I saw his stigma wink.

> To kill him now does him a disservice at having thrived so long, but who’s to say how long his good fortune lasts. He demands a keeper, someone only meant to keep him safe. With my shears dulled, I’m only left to prune.
