# Cat Maps

Hidden throughout the world of Drehmal are dozens of easter eggs in the form of a "cat map," a filled map that depicts Priscilla, the cat of Drehmal co-creator Keeko100, sitting in a loafed position. These maps are found in item frames at numerous locations in the world, typically with only one map per structure. All [major towns](/World/Settlements/Official_Towns/) except for [[Firteid]] and [[Rhaveloth]] contain one Priscilla map, and they are almost exclusively found at major [Points of Interest](/World/Points_of_Interest/). 

![[Catmap.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

There are currently 60 known cat maps that can be found in the world. This list may be incomplete, as there has not yet been a systematic scan of the entire world to find all maps. Most of the cat photos are obtainable in normal gameplay, but some are located in areas that cannot be reached without using cheats and/or clipping out of bounds.

8 maps, all of Nima (see Fort Nimahj), were added in the 2.2.2 update. These are marked as "2.2.2 Nima".

## Towns

14 cat maps can be found in the major towns of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. The entries in these tables are numbered arbitrarily; they can be discovered in any order and are all a copy of the same item (except where denoted otherwise).
