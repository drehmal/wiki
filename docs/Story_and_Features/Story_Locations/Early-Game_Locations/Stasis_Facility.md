# Stasis Facility

The **Stasis Facility** is the first major story location in Drehmal, located in [[Capital Valley]] just south of the [[Primal Caverns]]. When a playthrough is begun by toggling the "Initialize" button in the settings room, any players will be transported to this facility, randomly placed in one of eight temporal stasis pods.

Within the story of the map, the Stasis Facility is a site where high-ranking [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] officials were to be frozen in time in the event of an empire-wide catastrophe, released a few years later in order to rebuild the empire. The player assumes the identity of one of [the eight officers on the bottom floor](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Stasis_Eight/), who are some of the only known survivors from the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's collapse]], with an unknown amount of time having since passed.

## Story (Early-Game)
Upon entering the world, the player awakes in a temporal stasis pod, being informed by [[avSYS]] that several pods have flatlined, and they are being forcibly evacuated. After breaking out of the pod, the player will find themselves in a chamber with 23 other stasis pods, many of which contain the corpses of Avsohmic officials.

After the facility is brought back online by the player, the first [holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/) can be found, which inform the player of their current situation. By reading these holotexts, the player will learn that they entered stasis due to some sort of emergency involving the "Ever-Fear," and that they had been in stasis for an incredibly long, but unclear, amount of time.

In the upper rooms of the facility, between office rooms and living quarters, a wall gives way to a room containing a statue of [[Drehmal]], as well as murals depicting the origins of the world. Taking a hint from one of the holotexts near the large unbreakable holo-door at the facility's exit, the player is able to deactivate the door, climbing a spiral staircase to the surface.

## Gameplay
Being the first location in the game, the Stasis Facility contains instances of some of Drehmal's core gameplay functions. Just past the very first room, a small node (similar to the one used to start the game) can be right-clicked to re-link the facility's holotext database. This mechanic reappears at other Avsohmic facilities throughout the story, restoring their holotext databases if adequate [[Terminus Network|tower]] linkage has been achieved.

Along the top ring of rooms, a wall with a single chiseled stone brick ![CSB](/assets/img/adv/chiseled_stone_bricks.png){ width="24" } can be found, just below a stone pickaxe in an item frame, named "DIG". This is the first instance of chiseled block variants being used to signal a secret to the player, as digging through this wall is required to progress to the mural/statue room and exit the facility.

At the holodoor, which cannot be broken normally, the game's first minor puzzle is given to the player. Taking a hint from one of the nearby holotexts, "[[stasis_smoke.md|Gohri's Safety Design]]," will allow the player to escape.

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    The holotext hints at the solution to the puzzle, referring to a safety feature that [[Gohri Zed]] built into the facility in case of a fire. The holodoor will open if excess smoke from a fire is detected near the door. Setting the ground near the door on fire with a flint and steel or placing a campfire down will trigger the door to open, allowing the player to progress.

## Original Writing
The Stasis Facility boasts [5 unique holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Early-Game_Holotexts/Stasis_Facility/) and [[Stasis Subject Roster|one book]].

The Stasis Facility was a project conceived of at the Ancillary Research Facility ([[Sal'Mevir]]), and was intended as a backup plan in case some kind of catastrophe befell Avsohm. The project seems to have been spearheaded by [[Thresa Vera]], working alongside Gohri Zed and [[Baen Vehmil]] while they were working for the Avsohmic Department of Science, and was initially intended to only function for a few years. Avsohmic temporal stasis projects saw significant advancement during the reign of [[Anyr]], to the point that partial stasis (in which the subject is physically frozen but fully aware of their surroundings) became commonplace as a punishment for criminals under his reign, specifically for any attempts at regicide.

When Avsohm was ravaged by mysterious forces, the Stasis Facility was put into full use sooner than expected. The events that caused the empire's extremely sudden downfall forced the present staff to go through with stasis. 

As seen on the "[[stasis_info.md|-STASIS SYSTEM LOG-]]" holotext, four other pods were opened and evacuated at some point in the 17 years prior to the player's awakening. These four pods (Pods 10, 20, 22, and 24) are visibly open in the starting room, and do not contain corpses like the others on the top two rows. The inhabitant of Pod 10, [[Kahmas Tuhs]], is a very pertinent figure in the world's history, while the other three names do not seem to be referenced elsewhere. Currently, it is not known if these characters are discoverable in the world.

??? warning "End-Game Lore Tie-Ins"
    Shortly afterwards, the facility was breached by an unknown entity. This entity appears to be the [[Emissary of the Void]], sent to sabotage the Stasis Facility. <br> 
    If the player digs into a particular wall in the Stasis Facility's main room, they may find a spiral staircase leading upward to a security room, which contains a still shot of the Emissary in the Stasis Facility, holding [[Oblivion]]. <br>

Upon finishing the end-game sequence at the [[Resonant Halls]], the player will be instructed to return to the Stasis Facility. Here, the player's [[yellow.md|end-game guide]] reveals their true identity, as well as opening a portal to the [[Court of Nothing]], pushing the player toward the final sequence of the story.
