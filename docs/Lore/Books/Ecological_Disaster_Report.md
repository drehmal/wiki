## Transcription
> An ecological disaster has struck. With the ongoing skirmish between the Frostfang Tribes and Avsohm over the land surrounding Mt. Yavhlix, tensions have been high. Homli Tahsgan, a member of the Tribes, used his unlimited potentia to push back Avsohmic forces... but something went wrong. Homli managed to create an intense blizzard that increased in size and severity until it grew out of control. That blizzard has enveloped the entire North. Faehrcyle, the Gulf, Merijool, and Casai have all been affected by this catastrophe. The land surrounding the mining operation at Mt. Yavhlix has become uninhabitable. Casualties are estimated in the tens of thousands. While this sounds bad, such a calamitous result means that we can continue energy extraction without interference. We have the technology to withstand the cold. It is the opinion of this intelligence officer that the operations in and around Mt. Yavhlix can safely increase in scale and frequency.
