**Azimuth Labs**, also referred to as **Alchemy Central**, is the first major story location in the end-game, and the former headquarters of the [[Red Dawn]] alchemical society, one of three major corporations that practically made up branches of [[Avsohm|Avsohm's]] government. Azimuth Labs was the site of Red Dawn's (and by extension, some of Avsohm's) most secretive projects, started toward the end of the empire's lifespan.

The entrance to Azimuth Labs is located at the [[Akhlo'Rohma#Sunken Astral Body|Sunken Astral Body]], east of the city of [[Dusps]], but it is blocked off by a veilstone barrier until a dedicated story sequence directs the player and allows access to the facility.

??? abstract "Coordinates"
    | **Location** | **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
    |:--------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
    | Sunken Astral Body Surface | 3160 |  74  | -989  |
    | Transportation Hub (Entrance) | 3274 | 36 | -664 |

    The first set of coordinates can be accessed at any point from the open world, at the surface of the Sunken Astral Body near the entrance to Azimuth. The second set, however, is within Azimuth Labs, so it should not be prematurely teleported to before its dedicated story sequence, due to risk of sequence-breaking the map.

## Story
Upon defeating [[Tethlaen_Boss|Tethlaen]] in the [[Nothing Island|Nothing]], the player is transported through a portal back to the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]], teleporting them to the other side of the portal, and a voice speaks to them through the in-game chat. This voice, whose name appears at this point as three yellow question marks, informs the player that their actions have effectively doomed the realm, removing the only seal that was preventing the realm of Drehmal from being flooded by chaotic [[Primal Energy|primal energy]] from the Nothing. Although the figure already believes that the player has learned too much, they resolve to help Avsohm's final remnant to weave together the final pieces of the puzzle. The voice instructs the player to return to the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]], and disappears.

When the player returns to the Terminus through the [[Mt. Yavhlix]] tower, another custom sequence will play out, in which [[avSYS]] is taken over by this presence, turning yellow and dispensing the "Silent Thing" [[Trinkets#Silent Thing|trinket]] in the compass dispensary. ![[silent_thing.png]]{ width="32" }

This item's description tells the player to "travel east of the painted city, a fallen fragment from the home of the deities."

Following this instruction will take the player to the Sunken Astral Body, as the voice continues to speak. After arriving at the entrance to the facility, the mysterious figure will conjure a beam of energy from the sky, blowing a hole in the ground through a layer of veilstone, and allowing the player to proceed.

The player then descends into a now-exposed underground tunnel, traveling through it into a large underground transit hub. During this sequence, the voice tells the player a story about the three Avsohmic [heads of state](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Emperors/): Emperors [[Drehn]], [[Ifeihl]], and [[Anyr]]. It tells the player that these three men all gradually increased the penalty for attempted regicide in Avsohm, escalating to the point that the crime was punishable by indefinite partial stasis, in which the subject was physically paralyzed but forced to consciously live forever as a prisoner inside their own body. The voice asks the player to consider the consequences of a successful regicide, and disappears as the player enters the facility proper.

![[azimuth_center.png]]
> The central rooms of Azimuth Labs.

The core of Azimuth Labs is made up of a central, circular chamber split into four rooms, each of which contains a holotext. In these holotexts, Avsohm's late-stage plans for global domination are made explicitly clear. The holotexts specifically concern Emperor Anyr's "ascension," part of the Apotheosis plan, asserting that it would allow Avsohm to achieve their greatest ambitions. These writings establish that Avsohm intended to force the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) into submission, and believed wholeheartedly that they had adequate technology to thoroughly defeat the forces of [[Maelihs]] in a day if they desired to do so. 

Deeper into the facility, the player can discover a portion of an unfinished Avsohmic warp tower, as well as a crack in a pipe leading to a side area that contains the [[Artifacts#Leliouria|Leliouria]] artifact. A hallway leads to the culmination of Red Dawn's efforts, their truest attempt at the [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]]: The God Machine.

> The God Machine in its entirety.

The God Machine is an absolutely colossal contraption, atop which a throne sits. The machine was given multiple different names over time, but ultimately, it was named after its one purpose and function: to turn one into a "god". 

This device was constructed specifically for Emperor Anyr, with the plan being to infuse Anyr with divine power, allowing him to truly reign as God-Emperor and challenge the Aspects and [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/). This would give the Empire of Avsohm complete domination over the realm of Drehmal. [[gm_status.md|A holotext]] near the apex states that the machine had initially succeeded in its job. And yet, when the player reaches the top of the God Machine, they are greeted by the corpse of Emperor Anyr.

The voice instructs the player to return to the Terminus, opening a portal back to the surface of the Sunken Astral Body.

## Gameplay
The player is placed into Adventure Mode when in Azimuth Labs.

There are no enemies to be found in this facility, nor are there puzzles. The player must simply explore, read, and learn the facility's secrets.

## Original Writing
There are [7 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-Yav/Azimuth_Labs/) to be found at Azimuth Labs.

There is also one original [lore book](/Lore/Books/) at Azimuth: [[Project Moonstrider]], written by [[Vohski Ottis]].

## Lore
Azimuth Labs was the headquarters of Red Dawn, an alchemical society that effectively functioned as a branch of Avsohm's government, handling many of their highest-level research projects. Some of the most secretive took place here, including projects designed to reverse aging, the creation of homunculi, and of course, the God Machine.

[[Vohski Ottis]] oversaw [[Project Moonstrider]] in this facility, designed to utilize runic magic to reverse the effects of aging. This project went very wrong, resulting in the death of a volunteer, causing Ottis to have a breakdown. This appears to be indicative of the sort of experimentation that was commonplace at Azimuth.

## Extras
"Azimuth" is a real English word, coming from the field of astronomy, similar to the Aphelion. An azimuth is the [horizontal angle between an object in the sky and a reference angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth), typically north.
