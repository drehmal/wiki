# Skullbeasts

**Skullbeasts** were massive, extremely powerful creatures created by the [[Skullmother]] and used for warfare by the [[Empire of Maelihs]] throughout the Third Avihm. They were responsible for some of the most significant destruction in the realm, including the destruction of [[Sal'Anyr]].

The exact canon appearance of the Skullbeasts is not clear, but they are known to have been ferocious, gnarled creatures of twisted flesh and exposed bone. Their bones can be found in several locations on the map, most prominently at the [[Birthing Grounds]], where they were all created.

It is heavily implied that the Skullbeasts are not a willing creation of the Skullmother, and that she was manipulated by Mael and his forces into creating these monstrosities.

Skullbeasts also had a few rare [[Drehmari]] followers, who grew entranced with them in spite of (or even due to) the havoc they were able to wreak. [[Ossein]] was one such "Skull Disciple", who grew obsessed with a Skullbeast named Femura and used [[Calamity|her claw]] as a weapon.
