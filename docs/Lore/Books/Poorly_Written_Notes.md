## Transcription
> It sometimes absolutely dazzles my gourd, but there are living Tehrmari on this very moon who cannot even comprehend the domain of Lahrs.
>
> He’s the Aspect of Resonance, man! How hard can that be? But I hear everything from “Aspect of Growth” to "Aspect of Cycles” to “Aspect of Mushrooms”. And even cats who do know the name of his domain don’t know what resonance is!
>
> Well, it’s time to yum their yuck. I sat down with Pholia, and we decided on a description that you can pull out if you don't have time to get into the specifics but need to educate someone. Here goes:
>
> Resonance is perfect harmony, like the concentric ripples from a pebble dropped in placid water.
>
> Resonance is the force which ensures that the birds come to roost every spring and pushes the mushrooms up from a forest floor.
>
> Resonance is the compromise that keeps Loe and Lai from destroying the climate in their feud, and keeps Maen’s pain from eclipsing fear or pleasure.
>
> Resonance is more complicated than any Avsohmic device and yet just as simple as an eternally spinning wheel.
>
> Resonance is the sound of the universe playing in concert.
>
> I think these just about cover it. Of course, it would be better if everyone had time to chill out and learn the specifics through some of our freshly picked fungi, but it seems like everyone’s always in a rush these days!
>
> Ah well. If they are interested at all in learning the long way, there is mush room here in Lopaja Town!
