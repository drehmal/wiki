# Zevve Kai

**Zevve (pronounced "ZEV-uh") Kai** was an [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] intelligence officer, and a highly trusted advisor of [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] during the empire's reign.

Zevve is one of the members of the Stasis Eight, the eight characters that players can spawn as. She was located in Pod 7.

## Description

A character description for Zevve from official promotion posts reads as follows:

> Zevve Kai was one of Emperor Anyr’s Intelligence officers and most trusted advisors. She has a knack for spinning stories and noting details. She’s a bit bitter, jaded, and quite sly. She seems tall from a distance, but once you approach her; you notice how small she really is.

Zevve is relatively short at 5'3" (~160 cm), but appears taller than she really is. This may be due in part to her tall antlers. She dresses in dark colors, dominated by black and purple, including a long overcoat and purple sash. She is slender and has an olive complexion.

## History

Zevve Kai's history is not well-known from in-map sources, as there is very little explicit characterization of her. The material that is given portrays her as a cunning advisor to Emperor Anyr, and it is seen that she resided in the Administrative Wing of the [[Av'Sal Repository]].

From the one holotext that she authored, it appears that Zevve's intelligence officer duties included the creation of propaganda to spread throughout the empire.
