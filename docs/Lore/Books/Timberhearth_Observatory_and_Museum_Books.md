This page contains the text of the nine unnamed books at the Timberhearth Observatory and Museum in [[Spearhead Forest]]. This building is a reference to the Museum in Timber Hearth in the game Outer Wilds. Each of the nine books is placed on a lectern and describes a nearby exhibit, typically of Avsohmic-era technology.

| 4133  |  127  |  281  |

### Summary
This book describes a rehntite catalyst, which fueled one of the many elevator chutes found in Avsohmic ruins.

### Transcription
> This rare, functional rehntite catalyst was very carefully removed and transported from the ruins of Av'Sal! The Avsohmic people were notoriously mistrustful of stairs, so they used these to get up and down places instead.

## Mosaic

| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4138  |  127  |  281  |

### Summary
This book is placed in front of a piece of gray glazed terracotta, presumably describing some kind of Sasquatch in Drehmal mythology.

### Transcription
> A beautiful mosaic taken from ancient Black Jungle ruins. It depicts the face of a now extinct mammal. It was large, very strong, covered in black hair, bipedal, and was native to the Black Jungle.

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4134  |  127  |  285  |

### Summary
This book is found before a brewing stand, rotting flesh, redstone dust, and a carnelian fungus.

### Transcription
> The ultimate goal of any alchemist is the achieval of "The Great Work", commonly defined by many as the usage of Divine Magic by a mortal. These are some common alchemic supplies, but who knows, these could just be the key to completing The Great Work...

## Rhaveloth Rubble

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4143  |  127  |  279  |

### Summary
This book is found in front of a pile of blackstone.

### Transcription
> A piece of rubble taken from inside Rhaveloth, the city fortress at the heart of the Carmine. The rock itself is obviously volcanic, possibly taken straight from the Carmine's deep layers of stone.

## Amethyst Cluster

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4138  |  127  |  277  |

### Summary
This book is found in front of an amethyst cluster.

### Transcription
> This beautiful gemstone was found left behind in Purity Peaks. It has a low concentration of divine magic, which is very unusual for any object.

## Heartwood Saplings

### Coordinates
| **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 4140  |  127  |  285  |

### Summary
This book lies between two saplings: a potted jungle sapling on the left, and a potted dark oak sapling on the right. This establishes that the [[South Heartwood]], pre-Desolation, was more of a jungle biome than a dark forest like the North.

### Transcription
> Two saplings, the left one being from the destroyed southern Heartwood, the right being from the present-day northern Heartwood. A tragic event caused the lives of thousands and the death of an entire ecosystem. We are incredibly lucky to have some specimens preserved.

### Summary
This book is found beside a sandstone wall and a piece of green concrete, which projects a crude version of holotext when stood upon. This is a reference to the writing system of the Nomai in Outer Wilds, as well as the holotexts found throughout Drehmal.

### Transcription
> This odd piece of early Avsohmic technology was taken from the ruins of Sal'Anyr. It contains what appears to be an early test of an apparatus used throughout that ancient empire. This is the only known example still functioning.

## Anti-Gravity Pillar

### Coordinates

### Summary
This book is found in front of two quartz pillars over a bottom-slab and below a top-slab, seemingly levitating.
