### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in the [[Dusps]] library. It tells of a fantastical, forgotten land that was home to [[Rihelma]].

### Transcription:
> My great-great grandfather tells a tale of a forgotten, mystical land, known only by the Aspects and their kin - Aldregakar, the Star-Rise. An enormous umber plateau that rises high into the clouds above a lush, exotic jungle. Waterfalls cascade down its impossibly tall cliffs, carving vertical paths in the dragon-forged stone.
>
> My grandfather said that Rihelma, Aspect of the Sky once called the Star-Rise her home. Not only was it a hidden sanctuary, it was too steep to climb for any mortal traveler.
>
> My grandfather told me he was granted passage to the broad, expansive summit. He was never able to properly articulate its simplistic beauty before his passing, but the snippets I heard told me it was truly magical. There doesn't exist a place quite like the Star-Rise.
>
> My grandfather's story is doubted by many. How could one lowly Drehmari discover such an important place? How come the Star-Rise has yet to be rediscovered after so many years? Some argue that Rihelma, in their cryptic wisdom, hid the mountain from sight so its beauty could not be tarnished by greed and gluttony.
>
> I so desperately wish to finish my grandfather's story, but even I sometimes doubt the existence of the Star-Rise.
>
> But my grandfather always reassured me. He told me that no Drehmari mind could ever dream of such an enchanting place.
>
> I suppose he's right.
