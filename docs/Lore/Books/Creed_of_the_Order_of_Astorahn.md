## Location/Summary
This book can be found in an item frame at the Astorahni Tower in the northwestern [[Gulf of Drehmal]] region, near the eastern edge of [[Merijool]]. It is written by a member of the Order of Astorahn, seemingly a banished sect of the devotees of [[Lai]] in Merijool.

## Transcription
> The warmth of Lai is simply pitiful, worthy of nothing but scorn. The foolish worm blathers about basic idiocies like "kindness" and "compassion"; does he not know the perils we face? Our hated enemy, that of the cold, encroaches every day. No. Only we blessed few see the true light, the light of the Torahn! Obviously! Lai cannot compete with the cruel heat of our sacred sphere. We have seen it, communed with it, and tested out mettle; we shall be victorious! The naive idiots back in Merijool who still trust in Lai shall rue the day they banished the Astorahnni!
