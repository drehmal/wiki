> 3rd of Ohmamari:
> Dad got a new job with the government today. He and Mom looked happy. I know he was trying to get this job for a while. Mom says he will be gone more now, which makes me sad. Before he left, he gave me this diary as a gift! He says that he will read it when he gets back from work.
>
> 7th of Virmaklah:
> Dad still isn't back from work, but he sends us letters sometimes. He says he can't talk about his job, because it's very secret and very important. I think it's super cool! I hope he's a super spy, sneaking around and messing up Mael's armies! I love my Dad.
>
> 11th of Torahnsohma:
> I know Mom said Dad would be gone more often, but I didn't realize how bad it would be. I'm starting to really miss him. We still get letters, sometimes, but he says he's really busy with a new project. I just hope he comes back home soon.
>
> 2nd of Tahsgantuo:
> We got moved to a new housing block today! It's directly attached to one of those new avSYS thingies. I don't really understand what they do, but they heat the home up! It's nice and toasty in here, even though it's frozen outside. Dad said his great new job helped pay for it!
>
> 5th of Tahsganrohma:
> Last night, the light on the avSYS thingy went out. Mom started freaking out a bit, and we started to hear people screaming outside. Mom locked the doors, but nobody tried to get in. I want to send a letter to Dad, but Mom says I can't anymore. What happened to him?
