## Transcription
> It has been many decades since I last climbed into the high steppes of Palisades Heath directly south of Av'Sal to visit Drehua Temple, but I cannot recommend it highly enough. The knowledge contained in the monastery's old tomes is far greater than that of any La'Tehrmari I have ever met. You should listen to a reading there and enjoy a cup of mountain tea. Sit and feel the wind as it blows over the temple's tall grasses and thousands of chimes.
