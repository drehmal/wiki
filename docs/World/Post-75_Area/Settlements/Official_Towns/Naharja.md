## Summary

![[naharja.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Naharja** (pronounced naw-har-yuh) is a city in [[Moen's Domain]], and the fifteenth official town in Drehmal. Naharja is the only official town whose population is predominantly [[Tehrmari]] rather than [[Drehmari]] or [[Maelmari]], and it is also the only official town on [[Lo'Dahr]]. Situated in the northeast of Moen's Domain, the town can be easily accessed by simply heading east from the lake where the Lo'Dahr tower lands after the [[Aphelion|75% Event]] is completed.

    Approximate Coordinates: `263, 75, -790`

Naharja is an extremely vibrant and colorful city populated entirely by Tehrmari, the race of dragon-like people found throughout Lo'Dahr and in the [[Purity Peaks]] region of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. The city sits upon a hill, with two large staircases leading up from the surrounding area in the north and south, respectively. Buildings are often built with one specific solid color, similar to the buildings in [[Dusps]], but with more variety in the pallette of blocks used. Crimson wood is heavily utilized as an accent, and the city is paved with white quartz/calcite roads.

Naharja is comparable in size to [[Firteid]], and is similarly one of the densest and largest towns in the map, alongside Firteid and [[Rhaveloth]]. 

This town is also home to a special mechanic, the Day of Patronage. Every fifth in-game day, the Day of Patronage festival will be celebrated in Naharja. During this festival, additional merchants spawn with new trades, fireworks are perpetually shot off around the city, and locals will offer gift items to the player when approached.

Entering Naharja for the first time grants the "Distant Lights" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[naharja_map.png]]
> The in-game map of Naharja, found at three different locations in the town.

Entering Naharja from the southern staircase (the natural point of entry if approaching from the Lo'Dahr tower), the player will find themselves on the lower level of the city, in the Night Lights district of shops. The first of three in-game town maps is found in this area, in an alleyway to the right after the first building.

There are multiple vertical levels to Naharja, with the majority of the shops being found on the lower level. Upper levels, on the other hand, including a few floating islands, are home to more general points of interest.

### Lower Level (Level 1)

The lowest level, which the two staircases up to the city from the surrounding terrain go to, is home to several of the city's merchants and smaller points of interest. This level extends the furthest to the west, and stops before reaching the eastern extents of the city.

#### Night Lights District

The Night Lights District is a neighborhood containing several shops and businesses, on the lower level of south-central Naharja. This area is home to six merchant locations, including Eliana's Map and Compass (the location of Naharja's unique [[Adventuring Merchant]]), a pet store, and more.

A [[Fervor Stone]] is hidden underground, in a secret building in this area.

??? warning "Fervor Stone Location"
    In the Night Lights district, enter the narrow alley between the pet store and the alchemist's shop, to the west. At the end of this alley, in a red concrete wall, trapdoors obscure two fence gates. Open both and crouch to pass through. This will take you to a room with a wooden "couch", and what appears to be a dead end.

    Look beneath one of the spruce stairs on the other side of the room to find a lever. Flicking this lever opens a hole in the wall down to a secret, underground building, seemingly depicting a bar and lounge. This building's interior is heavily decorated with custom banners.

    A chest behind an orange banner with what appears to be a yellow sun holds a Stone of Luxury.

#### Lunar Lights Inn and Suites

Located at the end of the eastern alleyway that also houses the Amethyst Merchant and the lower level's town map, Lunar Lights is Naharja's main inn. The Primal Cache room is located at the top of the building.

#### Moen Stones

Moen Stones is a crimson/carnelian wood store north of the Night Lights District, home to a merchant that buys and sells slate. The building this merchant inhabits is filled with small stone deposits.

#### Cornercopia Meats

A lime-colored store located on the street corner north of Moen Stones, this shop is home to a Meat Merchant.

#### Patronage Calendar

In north-central Naharja, at the base of a staircase leading upwards towards the second level of the town, a lectern with the [[Pronouncement of Patronage]] book sits. This book declares that the Day of Patronage is to be celebrated every Vehlar (a day of the week), and the monument behind this lectern has five signs, one illuminated in yellow. When the bottom sign—which reads "Vehlar"—is illuminated, it is the Day of Patronage.

#### Farmland

The land to the north of Naharja is utilized for farming, filled with fields containing several unorthodox crops such as twisting vines, carnelian fungi, crucible (nether) wart, and dripleaf plants. 

![[nah_statues.png]]

The staircase down to the farmland is flanked by two larges statues of pink and white animals, in a pose resembling real-life sphinx statues. These are believed to depict [[Moen]], the Aspect whose domain Naharja is found in.

#### Orchard's Blessing

Following the city-level path west from the statues, an orange building sits at the end of the road. This is Orchard's Blessing, a high-end restaurant home to the "Fancy Waiter" merchant.

#### Whitewall Bank and Trust

Next to Orchard's Blessing in western Naharja, a green and red building serves as the town's bank. Here, the Bankteller merchant stands behind a counter, and offers the local currency (amethyst shards) in exchange for scales, at a 7 scales:3 amethyst ratio.

### Middle Level (Level 2)

Two staircases from the lowest level lead up to Naharja's middle level: one behind the Patronage Calendar, and another to the east of the main road, near Moen Stones and Cornercopia Meats.

The western area of Level 2 holds several more buildings, some residential and some which appear to be shops but do not actually contain a merchant. Far to the west, a tunnel through the nearby mountains has been dug, leading to a scenic overlook of Moen's Punchbowl, the lake in which the Lo'Dahr tower lands.

#### Art Museum

Up another set of stairs in the west, the road turns from white to black slate. Here, more buildings can be found, including the Founders' Legacy Museum of Art, home to abstract sculptures and paintings that seem to be relevant to the history of the moon.

#### Kavn's Forge

Kavn's Forge is the shop of Naharja's primary [[Runic Blacksmith]], in eastern mid-level Naharja.

#### Yriel Plaza

![[nah_yriel.png]]

A plaza in the eastern middle level houses a statue of [[Yriel]], the Moonsworn, servant of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/). At the base of the statue is a sign that reads "PROPHET YRIEL THE MOONSWORN", and they are depicted with their [[Syzygy|signature crossbow]].

One of the in-game town maps is found next to this statue.

### Upper Level (Level 3)

The upper level of Naharja comprises everything at or above the y-level of the bridge connecting the upper western and eastern districts of the city (y=111). This section is home to larger points of interest, and is inhabited (lore-wise) by the wealthier and more powerful La'Tehrmari residents of the city, such as the Scalebound Priests and Wingmakers (and historically, the Talon). Its streets are predominantly black rather than white, with the exception of the bridge.

#### Naharja Public Library

Located in the western upper level, the Naharja Public Library is home to many bookshelves, but no actual lore books.

#### Scalespeaker's Palace

At the far eastern end of Naharja, overlooking the entire city, is the palace of the Scalespeaker: the spiritual leader of the Scalebound, the La'Tehrmari priests. The palace is easily the largest singular building in Naharja, and contains several intriguing rooms, including a lower chamber with a large banner seemingly depicting the [[Primal Tree]] and 11 glazed terracotta blocks throughout its branches and roots.

![[nah_palacemural.png]]
> The mural room in the Scalespeaker's Palace. 

#### Observatory Island

An observatory sits atop floating island above south-central Naharja, looking up at the stars. The [[Astronomer's Notes]] book can be found on a lectern here.

In the rooms below the observatory, a chest behind tinted glass can be found with the [[Artifacts#Equinox|Equinox]] artifact.

## Unique Villagers

Merchants in Naharja deal entirely with amethyst shards as currency, rather than scales.

At baseline, there are 14 unique named villagers in Naharja, with 13 of them being stationary merchants. The only non-merchant is a Tehrmari named "Cloudtamer Triil", who is found on top of a cloud above eastern Naharja.

### Adventuring Merchant

Naharja's [[Adventuring Merchant]] is Adventuring Merchant Eliana, the owner of Eliana's Map and Compass next to the southern entrance to the city.

If you're having trouble finding 'em, I'm fairly certain that the Prismatic Council chamber at Ytaj - the giant dome - has murals on the wall that might help.

### Runic Blacksmith

The primary [[Runic Blacksmith]] in Naharja is located in Kavn's Forge, in the southeastern portion of the city's middle level.

This Runic Blacksmith also offers one armor trim, Runic Amplifiers, and a total of [[Artisan Items#Tharxax City|seven artisan items]], including the full 4-piece upgraded "Vivid" diamond artisan set. Each piece of this set increases its wearer's total armor by 12%.

## Day of Patronage

The Day of Patronage is a festival that occurs every five in-game days in Naharja, and follows a unique mechanic. 

On every Day of Patronage that the player is in Lo'Dahr, at 6 AM in-game, a message in chat will play, which reads: "The Day of Patronage has begun in Naharja!"

Villagers in the city will begin the day's festivities, shooting fireworks into the sky. Each villager in Naharja will also throw one gift to the player on the Day of Patronage, similar to vanilla villagers after successfully clearing a raid, but with a custom loot table (found below). 

Most notably, 13 new traders come to Naharja for the Day of Patronage to sell their wares, doubling the number of custom merchants in the town. Signs also appear around the town, advertising the new merchants.

At 5 AM the following day, the special merchants will despawn, and the message "Festivities have ended in Naharja..." will play in chat.

### Villager Gift Loot Table

This merchant also shares a name with the presumptive author of [[Wehndan's Gratitude]], a book in the [[Rehntite Cave]] about the discovery of that location and its importance to [[Avsohm]]. It seems highly unlikely that this is the same person, considering the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's fate]] and the time difference between when that book would have been written and the present day (at least 1200 years), but this is not clear.

??? warning "Gourd Merchant Easter Egg"
    Utilizing vanilla Minecraft's special holiday feature of giving mobs carved pumpkin heads on Halloween, the datapack performs a check on every Day of Patronage to determine if it is currently Halloween. On the occasion that it is Halloween and the player has a Day of Patronage, an alternative version of the Gourd Merchant will spawn, who has all of the normal trades, plus one additional trade for a joke/easter egg Artisan Item. <br> <br>
    This item, the *Very Large Pumpkin*, is an artisan carved pumpkin which can be purchased for 1 amethyst shard and worn as a helmet, granting 2 armor and +1 Charisma. It also has a custom model which is notably larger than normal pumpkins, showing as such when in player inventories and when held/worn.

## Lore

It is unclear exactly when Naharja was founded, but it appears to have been the center of [[Tehrmari]] power on Lo'Dahr for an extremely long time. The city is effectively run by the Scalebound, the clergy of the immortal La'Tehrmari who have ruled over their Ro'Tehrmari counterparts for the vast majority of recorded history. Founded by [[Tehra]], the "first Tehrmari", the Scalebound are centered in Naharja, with their leader, the Scalespeaker, living in the palace at the upper eastern end of the city. Tehra was known as a good friend of [[Moen]], and likely was the Scalespeaker for most of her life, setting the precedent for La'Tehrmari to be chosen by [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) whose trust they had earned. 

The Empire of Rohei, the strongest Ro'Tehrmari state in the moon's history, was born out of Naharja from two rival factions. Among the lower, poorer districts, two gangs formed: the Clasahlians and the Nelahvans, led by former best friends Asa Clasahle and Meri Nelahvan. Originating from a petty feud between the friends, the gangs eventually devolved into bloody skirmishes in the streets of Naharja, on occasion spilling out into the upper districts and damaging key landmarks in the city. This violence eventually led to the Scalebound exiling both clans from the city and giving them a patch of land to the south to live on. The two groups reconciled, and banded together to form the Free Lands of Rohei.

Since that time, Ro'Tehrmari and La'Tehrmari have lived in Naharja together, with the La'Tehrmari generally being oppressive towards their counterparts. However, over time, the La'Tehrmari numbers have dwindled, and the Ro'Tehrmari have become such a majority across the moon that the La are unable to truly extort the Ro.

It appears that the residents of Naharja primarily engages in worship of [[Moen]], Aspect of Pleasure, likely due to the fact that they live in her [[Moen's Domain|domain]], but the La'Tehrmari generally do not have strong feuds between themselves over which Aspects they worship. Rather, the La'Tehrmari appear to simply encourage the worship of the Aspects at large, particularly through the Wingmakers, their missionary/recruiting faction.

### Trivia

![[naharja_golem.png]]{ align=left width="100" }

Runic Golems in Naharja (and throughout Moen's Domain) have a custom texture, taking on a dark purple and yellow color scheme similar to the map's re-texturing of celestial (netherite) gear. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

### Soundtrack

Naharja's theme song is "Lunar Renaissance", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.

### Merchant Respawn Commands

In the event that one of the custom merchants in Naharja is turned into a witch or dies, the following commands can be used (through a command block) in order to respawn them. See [[FAQ#Can Custom Villagers Be Respawned?|this page]] for more information on these commands. Day of Patronage merchants are not included in this list, as they are killed and respawned naturally by the game already.
