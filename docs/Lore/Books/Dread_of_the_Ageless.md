This book can be found in a chest in the library near the top of [[Ihted Academy]]. It contains a description of a monster from the sky that killed the Avsohmic officers at the [[Ring Facility]] on the [[Fall of Avsohm|day of the empire's fall]], which took the form of a creature with "knotted, repulsive wings" before transforming into a drill and descending upon the facility.

## Transcription
> The twisted thing was visible first in the clouded sky above the invaders’ building. For an instant it hovered there on knotted, repulsive wings, and light itself bent around fractals of matte black and deep crimson. Then, a sound echoed through the lakebed, across the dying village, and through the bones of all onlookers assembled. It was serene at first hearing, a single clear, metallic note which rang out much like the bell on the tip of the Scalespeaker’s staff. But instead of running its course and dissipating, the sound slowly began to pitch up and down into an unsettlingly beautiful vibrato.

> And then, its form distorting and unwinding into a drill, it dove down towards the facility and disappeared. Only one gurgled scream punctured the totality of the thing’s artificial ostinato. Less than two minutes later, a cloud of crimson was visible within the cobalt waters, and the chiming gradually began to diminish. For a few long moments, all assembled looked at each other in anxious bewilderment. Finally, a party led by the venerable Ya’kruul descended into the facility which had so recently been full of activity, life, and magic. The same expression of disgust began to register on the faces of all assembled: though the Drehmari of Avsohm were unwelcome guests, no one deserved to die so easily.
>
> An even more horrible realization dawned on the eldest among the Mystics: Khive themselves would have stood no chance in combat against the power this new enemy wielded.
