# Orix's Rumination

This holotext can be found in a room above the main stasis chamber area, and contains [[Orix Cehein]]'s ruminations on the failsafes developed by Avsohm, and suggests that something at the source of the seal necessitates these failsafes.

> As we enter the final stages, numerous failsafes have been developed. Stasis, the seal, network collapse, the secondary source. I was a major part of the seal’s development, what I saw in that facility necessitated its creation. If that fails… stasis should be an acceptable alternative.
