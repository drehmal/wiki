**Maen's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the exiled Aspect of Hate, [[Maen]]. This region resembles a cross between the Basalt Delta and Soul Sand Valley biomes in vanilla Minecraft's Nether. The region sits very close to the geographic center of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Dahr's Domain]] to the south, [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the west, [[Moen's Domain]] to the northeast, and [[Nahyn's Domain]] to the east.

## Geography

Maen's Domain is relatively small and irregularly shaped, effectively being one circular valley with longer protrusions to the north, northeast, and southeast. This valley is primarily made up of basalt, gray/light gray terracotta, soul sand, and soul soil (which appears light blue in Drehmal's resource pack). Lava lakes fill the bottom of the valley.

The landscape is dotted with custom trees, whose trunks are built either of blackstone or obsidian, and whose "leaves" are the custom dark red cobwebs found in this region.

In the north, a giant sword acts as a bridge between Vayniklah's Domain and Moen's Domain.

### Biome Details

Maen's Domain is made up of the **Wooded Badlands Plateau** biome.

Water appears black in this region, and the skybox has a distinct red hue. Grass blocks and cobwebs both have custom textures in this biome, appearing dark red as well.

## Gameplay

Three different types of custom spiders can spawn in Maen's Domain.

**Soulspinners** are custom spiders that temporarily decrease a player's max health on a successful hit.

**Spawnspinners** are custom spiders that split into three smaller cave spiders named **Spawnspinner Offspring** on death.

**Webspinners** are custom spiders that shoot cobwebs towards nearby players.

## History

Maen's Domain was once home to the Coven of Alchemists, a group of alchemists who sought to understand the three Primal Emotions. It is unclear if this group was directly influenced by Maen, simply given sanctuary in his domain, or had nothing to do with him directly, rather inhabiting the region after the Aspect was exiled to [[Loruhn]]. Through the experiments at their castle, the Coven discovered that the three Primal Emotions were Pain, Pleasure, and Fear, and that eliciting large amounts of these emotions could serve as fuel for alchemical processes.

[[Maen]] himself has likely not been able to directly maintain his domain since his exile to Loruhn at the end of the [[Divine Schism]], meaning that this region has probably been mostly untouched by divine hands for over a thousand years.

## Points of Interest

### Coven of Alchemists

The [[Coven of Alchemists]] was a group of [[Alchemy|alchemists]] living in a castle near the center of Maen's Domain. This castle contains several lore books detailing its unethical experimentation, which resulted in knowledge on the three Primal Emotions—Pain, Pleasure, and Fear. An [[Artifacts#Involuntary Ranged Injection Mechanism|artifact]] can also be found here.

### Underground Dungeon

A small dungeon can be found underground, accessed from the northeastern protrusion of the region. In an area mostly covered by soul sand and custom cobweb trees, a blackstone platform with a single chiseled stone brick can be found. Breaking this block will reveal a hole down to an obsidian dungeon, with some custom named enemies and modest loot.
