| **Titles** | Infernal Lailoehn |
| **Classification** | [Minor Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Minor_Aspects/) |
| **Family** | [[Lai]] (Parent) |
| **Gender** | Masculine (he/him) |

## Characteristics

Lailoehn's passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] says:

> Infernal Lailoehn, Aspect of Fire
> -------------------
> Child of Lai, he is ferocious, gluttonous, and disdainful.

Lailoehn's personality is fiery to match his domain, as noted above. He is depicted in a small statue shown at the top of this page, appearing to be a relatively generic winged red dragon.

Lailoehn is stated to be in a romantic relationship with [[Loeleyhn]], the Aspect of Snow and child of [[Loe]].

## Role and Powers

Lailoehn, as Aspect of Fire, is responsible for the most powerful common fire. His fire is one of five distinct types in the realm, considered to be more powerful than regular, chaotic fire and [[Virtuo]]'s orderflame, and similar to his father's Sacred Flame. Lailoehn is stated to have blessed some preferred noble families who worshipped him with the gift of his powerful flame, allowing them to become expert [[pyromancy|pyromancers]].

Lailoehn also wields this extremely powerful flame himself, likely proving a very formidable combatant.

## In-Game References

The only place where Lailoehn is clearly worshipped in Drehmal is a [[Mt. Ebonfire#Lailoehn Temple|small temple in western Mt. Ebonfire]], which holds the statue of the Aspect shown at the top of this page. It is also home to the [[Artifacts#Sparkstoker|Sparkstoker]] artifact, which reads:

> Lailoehn is known to have as much greed as the fire of his domain and twice as much pride, but he repays those who stroke with ego with light and protection. This tool was used to stoke a flame which burned throughout three consecutive Avihms.

Lailoehn is also referenced in [[Flamestoker Ghulak's Sermon]], a book in [[Rhaveloth]] written by a [[Maelmari]] priest. Within, Lailoehn is said to have aided the Maelmari in their wars on the disc, on the instruction of Lai.

![[room_lailoehn.png]]

Lailoehn has a small room in [[Ytaj]], an offshoot of Lai's room.

Lailoehn is also mentioned in the [[Scion's Diary]] book on Lo'Dahr, which establishes the existence of a new, 5th type of flame introduced by a strange pyromancer, whose flame is even stronger than Lailoehn's. This book was seemingly written by a student pyromancer of the Brulante family in [[Lai's Domain]], whose [[Lai's Domain#Brulante Manor|manor]] can be found in that region.
