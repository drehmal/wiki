## Transcription
> Lord Maelihs was thorough when he destroyed the foul work of the Defiler. There is nothing left but smoldering rubble. But my work crew has dealt with worse. The egg-head team wants us to reclaim whatever we can, and then build a new tower at the exact same location. Supposed to be some new star-gazing project or something. Bah, who cares about the details, I'm just here to build a damn good tower.
