# Khive

**Khive** (pronounced with a hard "K" sound and rhyming with "dive") is the Aspect of Magic. One of the four Elder Aspects alongside [[Rihelma]], [[Dahr]], and [[Taihgel]], Khive is often considered the most powerful of the Aspects due to his ability to directly control [[Primal Energy]].

Khive is perhaps the single most-discussed and most thoroughly characterized Aspect in the map.

## Description

Khive's passage in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Mystic Elder Khive, Great Arcane Aspect
> ***
> Khive is the Great Aspect who created Runic Magic, and gifted the power of the arcane to mortals. Considered the most powerful Aspect, Khive strictly stays out of the affairs of Drehmari. Few have ever seen his visage.

Khive is depicted as very wise and powerful, but reclusive, cautious, and distrustful of the [[Drehmari]].

Khive's physical form resembles a large lizard, similar to a bearded dragon.

### Color/Build Scheme

Khive is very heavily associated with the color yellow, as well as the flarepod (shroomlight) block. His builds often utilize a yellow and black color scheme, infused amethyst blocks, and red sandstone (particularly in ring structures).

## Role & Powers

Khive's powers are the most clearly outlined of the Aspects. As the Aspect of Magic, he is able to directly harness the power of [[Primal Energy]], capable of using it in its raw forms as a generic form of laser-like energy in combat. However, Khive is not able to access any of the specific applications of this energy: he cannot harness the power of lightning or create thunderstorms like [[Palaesida]], he cannot use the primal energy to create mountains like [[Nahyn]], and so on.

Khive is responsible for granting the other Aspects access to the powers of Primal Energy, creating channels for the energy to flow from his personal stockpile to the Aspects, and therefore powering all of the others. Similarly, he taught the rules of magic to mortal [[Drehmari]] in Av1, creating runic magic to allow the mortals access to magic in small amounts. 

## History

Khive is one of the four Elder Aspects, the first Aspects made by the [[Primal Tree]] to build the fundamental parts of the world. As Aspect of Magic, Khive's role was different from the other Elders, who created physical parts of the realm. Khive's purpose was to allow the other Aspects to utilize Primal Energy, and to establish the rules of the [magic system](/Lore/Magic/) himself.

In the First Avihm, Khive determined that mortals could benefit from limited use of magic, and devised the runic magic system. Mortals born without the inherent ability to use Divine Magic could carve special runes into materials with [[potentia|intrinsic power]] to achieve specific effects, such as creating fresh water, lighting a fire, or physically protecting themselves. This would lay the table for all future forms of magic in Drehmal that were used by mortals.

Khive is believed to have taught mortals directly (the most devoted of whom were known as the Mystics) at the lost Av1 city of Ihted. Somehow, this went horribly wrong, as the Drehmari pushed magic further than the Mystic Elder had expected, likely culminating in [[Aok]]'s mysterious attainment of the [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]] at some point in Av1.

Due to his experiences with the Drehmari and the regret he felt for teaching them magic, Khive adopted a strict policy of non-interference in mortal affairs, likely at some point in late Av1 or early Av2. He has been minimally active on Drehmal since then, although it seems plausible that he fled to the disc to wait out the [[Divine Schism]].

Khive created the [[Trinkets#Khivian Scroll of Sanctuary|Khivian Scrolls of Sanctuary]], trinkets used by [[Tehrmari]] to warp home at a moment's notice. He seems somewhat more willing to work alongside Tehrmari today, but not much is known on this front.

Khive's most recent known act was in Av3 902, when he summoned [[Maelihs]] and [[Virtuo]], telling them their true Av1 origins and the state of the [[Maelruhn]] and [[Viruhn]] for the first time, showcasing his knowledge of the realm's full history. This information appears to have been monumental in Maelihs' descent into depression, and Virtuo's decision to leave the continent, ending the Third Avihm the following year.

## Devotion Guide

Khive's [[devotion]] site is the small ruined town of [[Ihted]] in eastern [[Capital Valley]].

The devotion altar itself is located at the top of the town's partially ruined ziggurat, surrounded by low-level offerings: primal pearls, books, and chiseled blocks of all types. The nearby hint book, [[Mercenary's Resignation]], suggests that the pertinent information would be contained in brewing stands, and that they have found nothing above ground.

Several brewing stands in the underground portion of Ihted do, however, contain higher-level offerings for Khive's devotion.

## Late-Game Info

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "LD_spoiler.md"

Khive has a particularly massive presence on [[Lo'Dahr]], more so than any of the other Aspects.

![[room_khive.png]]

Khive has a very prominent tower in western [[Ytaj]], with a secondary devotion altar and a mini-ring puzzle. Khive is mentioned by [[Maelihs]] as one of the few Aspects who still makes frequent physical visits to Ytaj.

![[ytaj_statue_khive.png]]

A statue of Khive sits to the northwest of the palace complex, pictured above. He is depicted as a large bearded dragon with multiple flowering tails, holding a ball of energy in his hand. A cloud of runes hovers in the sky above him.

[[Khive's Domain]] in the northwest is an extremely distinctive black and yellow hilly landscape. Here, the player can find Khive's trial, at the [[Mystic Gallery]], which rewards them with [[Stasis Bolt|Stasis Bolts]].

Players will also find [[Ihted Academy]] here, the arcane institution of higher learning from the original Av1 city where Khive taught mortals magic. Somehow transplanted onto Lo'Dahr, it still stands today, and contains very deep lore information. The [[Codex Celestus]], a very long deprecated book written by the Mystic Elder themselves, sits at the top of the structure. Within, Khive writes on what he knows about the universe's fundamental truths, the creation of the Aspects (with an exceedingly rare suspected reference to [[Verrhys]]), and rumination on what he believes will eventually cause the death of the realm.

Khive's most prized possession plays a central part in story progression on Lo'Dahr: the [[Numencore]], his personal stockpile of Primal Energy deep within the moon. This colossal orb of energy is the source of almost all the Aspects' divine power, and [[Avsohm]] discovered its existence, constructing a secret facility by its side for their own causes.

!!! danger "End-Game spoilers begin here. If you have not at least reached the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]], you have not seen this yet."

??? warning "Post-LD Khive Content"
    In order to progress, the player must charge the Inert Mythbreaker at the Numencore, which was the single largest barrier to Avsohm initially enacting that same plan. A greatly angered Mystic Elder then breaks his non-interference rule, attempting to smite the player by sending enemies and barrages of aerial energy blasts at the player in a chase sequence known as the "Mythbreaker Run". 
    
    During this sequence, Khive will [[Khive Dialogue|speak]] to the player, accusing them of attempting to carry on [[Anyr]]'s plan and cursing their insubordination. He will relent when the player reaches [[Mt. Yavhlix]], ominously warning them not to "hark to the whispers" before disappearing.

    Returning to one of Khive's devotion shrines after finishing the run will reset players' devotion to him back to 0, playing the message: <br>
    "Your devotion to Khive has been decimated..."

    This does not prevent the player from gaining devotion points, but it does reset progress.
