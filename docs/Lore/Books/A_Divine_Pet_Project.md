This book can be found on a lectern, at the top of the [[Mihkmari]]-inhabited tower in the [[Verdant Labyrinth]] region. It contains lore on the aspects, including [[Khive]] and [[Tethlaen]], as well as rumination on the origins of [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

## Transcription
> Dear diary,
>
> Today I began my cataloguing of the Aspects. I plan on writing about each of them in extensive detail, in the event that we are forced to come face to face with one. After all, a bandit group controlling such a large area could be cause for alarm... not deity alarm, but it's still good to have.

> Khive is incredibly intriguing. Could they be assumed to be the true creator of the realm, as they are the provider and creator of magic? Without Khive, the other Aspects would be unable to carry out their powers. Drehmal, Maelihs, and Virtuo would be mere mortals without Khive's blessing. Apparently, Khive doesn't mind - they like the lack of attention.

> Tethlaen is... incredibly odd. There's not much on him. He was last heard from in the 32nd year of the Second Avihm, before the Great Deity War. That's practically prehistoric. He supposedly flew too far north and fell off the face of the realm... but why? Why would a being of such great status do such a stupid thing? This just raises more questions. Can you really fall off the realm? What's at the edge? Is there nothing? This is exciting. Tethlaen will take up a good chunk of my research.

> After extensively looking through several papers that try to document pre-Deity War, I've come with some sort of conclusion... well, two pieces of information that most likely do not connect to each other at all. Early Drehmari art of Faehrcyle depicts it as the original, warmer (but still incredibly cold) climate it used to be... but there are zero references to Mt. Yavhlix, the tallest mountain in the realm. There is one very rudementary map depicting the northwestern coastline of the region and its most defining feature, Mt. Yavhlix, is completely missing. Just an ocean. These pieces are dated to be from the second decade of the Second Avihm, before Tethlaen disappeared. In the third decade, some pieces do map out the mountain in its entirety. This is also when traditional Faehrcylian fear-based culture began to form. All of this has hardly any connections, but this was the only major event I could find that happened during this time period. I'll try collecting further data and forming my own conclusion. Maybe I'll travel north myself.

> I'm still completely lost on this one. There is nothing else pointing to conclusive evidence on the true fate of Tethlaen, or the mysterious appearance of Mt. Yavhlix. I've all but given up for now. Maybe I'll return to this topic later.
