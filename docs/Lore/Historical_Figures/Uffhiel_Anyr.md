Uffhiel Anyr (*insert full name*) was an [Avsohmic[Empire of Avsohm] aristocrat and general, and later the third and final emperor of Avsohm. He was installed in power in the wake of [[Zorhis Iffeihl]]. Anyr was a compelling choice due to his military experience, and he quickly earned the support of most of the Avsohmic population, popularizing Centralist politics. Although the economy prospered and technology continued to rapidly advance under his rule, the government was also made more authoritarian and freedom of speech was sometimes repressed. Anyr's reign and life were cut short by the abrupt events that caused the [empire's fall[Fall of Avsohm]].
