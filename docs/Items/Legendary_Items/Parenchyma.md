**Parenchyma** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

A legendary chestplate supposedly crafted by nature itself and found at the [[Glade of the Giant]] in [[Merijool]], Parenchyma is an extremely powerful item in its own right, granting small amounts of healing on a successful kill.

## Gameplay
Parenchyma is an NBT-modified golden chestplate, retaining its low durability, offset by the Unbreaking X and Mending enchantments that it naturally comes with.

The chestplate grants no armor, and its primary mechanic comes from its special ability, which regenerates approximately 6 hearts upon a successful kill. (1) This is indicated by the appearance of a green heart in the place of the slain entity, which then draws a few green lines toward the player and refills a portion of their health bar. Paired with other weapons and armor, Parenchyma can become an absolutely central part of any build.

1. This change was enacted in the 2.2.2 update. Previously, Parenchyma gave 5 armor, and regenerated about 3 hearts per kill.

## How to Obtain
Parenchyma is located in the Glade of the Giant, a massive jungle caldera located in southeastern [[Merijool]] which is home to the Primal Sapling, a colossal spruce/dark oak tree. At the base of the Primal Sapling, a small opening leads into a short series of tunnels. These culminate in a drop down to the final room, where the trapped chest with Parenchyma sits on top of a stump.

## Lore
Parenchyma appears to be very closely tied to the Primal Sapling, the great tree which it is found underneath. Lore about the Primal Sapling is not exactly abundant, but it is known that this was the result of an attempt by the Life Aspect [[Vayniklah]] to rebuild the fallen [[Primal Tree]]. The end result is referred to as a cancerous growth, and a malignant force that does not hold the same power as the original Primal Tree.

Parenchyma's item description doubles down on this idea of the Sapling being cancerous, with its name "Parenchyma" coming from a term that is used often to refer to the functional tissue of a tumor. The term "Neoplasia," the item's ability, refers to the process of tumor formation (creation of a neoplasm). These seem to make it very clear that the Primal Sapling is a cancerous growth, which could carry multiple meanings. The Sapling may be uncontrollable, growing far more than it was intended to, or it may simply be malignant.
