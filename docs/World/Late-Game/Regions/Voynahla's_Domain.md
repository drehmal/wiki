## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[voy_domain.png]]

**Voynahla's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the partially-deceased Aspect of Death, Soul-Stealer [[Voynahla]]. This region is dark and hostile, littered with gravestones of Voynahla's followers and centered around a blood-red river. The region sits in the south-southeast portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, between [[Dahr's Domain]] in the west, [[Palaesida's Domain]] in the north, and [[Rihelma's Domain]] in the east.

Grass blocks appear jet black if placed in the biome, but are not naturally a part of the terrain.

## Geography

Voynahla's Domain is set within a large depression, almost entirely below y=30, and is made up of rolling black hills and a massive red river/lake. The only vegetation comes in the form of fleshy, red and white flowers, which either grow out of the ground or emerge from the many tombstones that dot the landscape. Other bone block structures are also found in this region, loosely resembling reeds or saplings of some sort.

The region's defining body of water runs north to south through the approximate center of the region, fed by a waterfall originating from the western side of Aldregakar. Several small docks are found at various points throughout this body of water, often leading to points of interest in the region.

## Gameplay

Chthonic Skeletons (Wither Skeletons) spawn in this region, being the domain of a dead Aspect.

Two custom hostile mobs are also found in this region.

## History

Voynahla's Domain has an interesting history, particularly concerning its patron Aspect, the [[Voynahla|Aspect of Death]]. Voynahla took his own life during the [[Divine Schism]], after realizing that his dominion over death meant that he could live in an eternal state of partial undeath if he were to perish, abandoning his physical vessel. It is unclear what effect this had on the region in terms of the terrain, but his followers began to commit mass suicide in his wake, and it is their gravestones that make up the vast majority of the domain's features in the modern day.

It is also known that Voynahla's skull was exhumed after his death, on his own orders, and it is possible that it was moved to his shrine in [[Ytaj]].

Despite its inhospitable appearance, it seems that Voynahla's Domain was populated at one point, with some Ro'Tehrmari hiding out in caves in this region, while the region effectively shared the town of Arkeje with its western neighbor, Dahr's Domain.

## Points of Interest

### Cathedral

In the center-west of the region, a massive black and red cathedral sits perched upon a hill. This structure is home to a miniboss, Conservator Ulavahn, who guards the [[Artifacts#Sepelitem|Sepelitem]] artifact, a celestial shovel which was used to bury the Aspect of Death's physical remains, then again to exhume his skull.

**Coordinates:** (X: 325, Y: 70, Z: 980)

### Gateway Crypts

In the southeast, a series of crypts is accessible through a surface structure, and a special-looking structure sits at the bottom. This can be turned into a different structure if something is activated elsewhere.

??? warning "Gate Info"
    This gateway is one of 6 portals between [[Overworld|Drehmal]] and [[Lo'Dahr]], and this one in particular is linked to the portal that the player can create in an alchemy fortress in [[Nimahj Swamp]], by flicking a lever. This portal cannot be opened from this side, and in fact, the gateway will not even appear until the other side is activated.

**Coordinates:** (X: 450, Y: 25, Z: 1274)

### Ro'Tehrmari Hideout

A dock at the far southeastern edge of the lake leads up to a cave. This cave, whose entrance is marked by redstone torches, is mostly infested by cave spiders. However, one collapsed passageway, if mined through, will reveal a small settlement inside the caves, alongside [[Ro'Tehrmari Manifesto|a book that describes the plight of the Ro'Tehrmari]]. This settlement may also be discovered through a one-block hole that acts as a vent, on the northern side of the mountain the caves are found inside of.

## Extras

The design of Voynahla's Domain is heavily inspired by the aesthetics of Bloodborne, drawing on the crumbling and fleshy tombstones, dark atmospheres, and prevalence of cathedrals in that game.
