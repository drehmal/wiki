# Firteid

![[firteid.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Firteid** (pronounced "fur-tide"), also known as the **City of Tides**, is a large city located in the northwestern [[Black Jungle]] region. The city sits at the mouth of the region's largest river, on its southern bank where it deposits into the Eye of Vir. The city can be accessed through a path that comes from the north, originating in the [[Verdant Labyrinth]]. It is also notably connected via a long bridge to the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] in the west.

	Approximate Coordinates: `3981, 67, 3382` 

In the modern day, Firteid is the most populous city in eastern Drehmal, and it is by far the largest [[Drehmari]] settlement on the continent, rivaled in size only by the [[Maelmari]] capital of [[Rhaveloth]]. Over 350 Drehmari villagers inhabit Firteid in-game, with a population exceeding 500 when including the Kiln of Virtuo's inhabitants.

Firteid takes heavy inspiration in its architecture from traditional East Asian architectural styles. Buildings are predominantly constructed with a combination of spruce and dark oak wood, in addition to blue-green or red roofs, made of dark prismarine, carnelian planks, oxidized cut copper, or prismarine.

The entire city is built upon a hill which runs from west to east, sloping up towards the Tidal Palace in the west.

In version 2.2.1 and above, Firteid has been made spawn-proof, as the area can already suffer from performance issues due to the number of villagers, and additional hostile mobs were known to cause significant lag (as well as zombify most of the town's population).

Entering Firteid for the first time grants the "City of Tides" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[firteid_map.png]]{ width="400" }
> The in-game map of Firteid, located at the fountain near the center of town.

Firteid is relatively organized, with named streets and clear, discrete districts that house its many points of interest. The city is surrounded by a 6-8 block-tall wall, and is roughly centered around a town square containing a three-tiered prismarine fountain. 

### Mountaintop House

Just across the river from the town proper, a small shack stands atop a tall, skinny prismarine mountain. This hut contains a [[Runic Catalyst]].

### Harbor District

North of the main city portion of Firteid is the Harbor District, a series of docks where airships and boats alike can be found. Decent loot can be found here, including the [[Letter Awaiting Delivery]] lore book.

### Hotel Bows

An expansive, prismarine-roofed hotel building in northern Firteid. This hotel does not contain a Primal Cache room.

The hotel's name is a reference to former Drehmal developer HotElbows, whose name is frequently misread as "Hotel Bows".

### The Gnarled Willow

In the northeast of the city center, a small restaurant named "The Gnarled Willow" is found. This building is home to the "Chef" merchant, who sells a variety of foods.

### Merchant Guild

To the northeast of the fountain, a large wooden building with a crimson roof serves as the Firteid Merchant Guild. This building holds several merchant stalls, but only one trader in version 2.2: the town's [[Adventuring Merchant]]. 

In Drehmal v2.1, this building housed all of the town's custom merchants, and it was also the inn building. The Primal Cache room in Firteid is still located here, in one of the guild member rooms on the top floor.

### Black Market

Directly beneath/behind (just to the east of) the Merchant Guild, a covert black market is obscured by trees from above and walled in on all sides. This market contains 5 custom traders, who either sell joke items or sell normal items at exorbitant prices.

An illicit fighting ring can also be found here.

### Firteid Library

Firteid's library is a relatively large, dark prismarine-roofed building in the northeast, just off the road at the main entrance to the city. It is home to two lore books. In the southern wing on the ground floor, [[Wellspring Day]] sits upon a lectern, describing the holiday of Wellspring Day, a Firteid-area tradition. 

The northern wing does not contain a book, but does have ladders which allow access to the Archives above, where the [[History of the Tidal Dynasty]] book is found.

### River Street Community

In the far northeast of the city, the River Street Community can be found. This is a residential area, with two lore books to be found: [[The Battle of River Street]], which depicts a comical feud between neighbors, and [[Strange Prayer]], a meta item referencing 2.2 co-lead developer DomeMaster.

### Botanical Research Center

Just to the south of the in-game town map, a building is dedicated to botany, and contains the [[Woes of a Botanist]] lore book.

### The Magma Flow Noodle Shop

Southeast of the fountain, The Magma Flow Noodle Shop is home to the Noodle Merchant, who sells two types of "noodles".

### Purity Chapel

In the southeast, a chapel is dedicated to [[Virtuo]], Goddess of Purity, and the only god officially worshipped in the city. The town's graveyard is found next to this building, but contains no hidden chests buried beneath any gravestones.

### Fountainhead Mall

Fountainhead Mall is a large building found at the southern end of the town square, with a statue of Virtuo found outside of the mall. The building's upper floors are home to a restaurant and the "Free Bird" Hotel, and its lower floors are home to four custom merchants. 

The Empty Angel Bar is located even further beneath the merchants' floor, and is, true to its name, empty. A target block at the end of the room, part of an old game, can be shot to reveal a passageway to the right, where a chest with a single scale sits as a reward. However, digging past the chiseled stone bricks at this final location leads to an extension of the tunnel, and at the end, the [[Artifacts#Crown of Peace|Crown of Peace]] artifact is located.

### Southern Firteid

There are fewer major points of interest in Southern Firteid, mostly being smaller residences, but the [[Runic Blacksmith]] can be found in this area, standing outside beneath a tent. The Jade Teapot, a tea shop with a custom merchant, is also located here.

The area to the far south is used for farming, with terrace farms growing multiple different crops as well as animal pastures.

### Royal Treasury Bank

Southwest of the fountain back in the main part of the city, the Royal Treasury Bank is located. There is not much actual money stored in this building, but there are two "Scalebroker" merchants, who will exchange gold for scales (buying gold from the player) at a 1:1 rate.

### Stone Building

Along Dynasty Way, the road that leads west from the fountain, a single stone building sits on the right, boarded up and covered in vines. The exact purpose of building was likely as either an embassy for [[Insohm]] to Firteid, or as a center of [[Green Serpent]] operation. The former seems to be the most likely, given that the book inside, [[The Origins of Green Serpent]], is written about the group from an outside perspective, and also references the [[Fall of Avsohm]]. 

A statue in the yard behind this building seems to depict two crude figures, one made out of prismarine and the other of blackstone, holding hands in unity. These figures may represent Firteid and [[Vulteid]], the Parochial Enclave of Firteid and [[Insohm]], or some other combination of sociopolitical entities.

### The Ladle

Further up Dynasty Way, The Ladle Baths and Spa is a bathhouse, which holds a rare loot item. [[THE BATHS ARE BACK!|A book]] at the receptionist's desk, written shortly after the establishment re-opened, also hints at the presence of an "odd piece of metal", which was stowed upstairs. 

The room this is located in is somewhat hidden, behind two trapdoors on the wall of the upper floor, and the chest containing it is in the ground, beneath another trapdoor. Opening this chest will reveal that the treasure is, in fact, a celestial chondrule (netherite scrap).

### Tidal Palace

The Tidal Palace is a large palace located at the western end of Firteid, at the top of the hill the city is built upon. Once the home of the despotic [[Tide Queen]], it stands today as a monument to the power of Firteid, and a reminder not to forget the city's past. 

The Palace Gardens to the south contain a shrine dedicated to the demise of the Tide Queen, with a sign that reads:

> Dedicated to the demise of the despicable Tide Queen <br>
> ??? - Av3 628 <br>
> May her tyranny rest with her.

Below these signs, what appears to be a coffin lies empty.

There are several villagers living in the Tidal Palace to this day, and many rooms contain decent loot, but the major point of interest within the palace is found in the Palace Staff Quarters, to the north on the ground floor.

#### Palace Staff Quarters

Inside the Palace Staff Quarters, a gradual cobblestone tunnel can be found, leading downward in a short spiral. This sign culminates in a blackstone wall with a chiseled blackstone brick, and breaking through this wall leads to a large hole in the ground. A series of partially ruined platforms leads down towards the bottom of the hole, but it is easiest to simply place water at the top of the hole and fall down with it.

The bottom of the hole is completely dark, and subsequently, filled with vanilla hostile mobs. Players must make their way up the stairs at the north end of this circular pit, where they will find a massive wall. Breaking through this wall leads to a courtyard, in the center of several rooms (potentially prison cells), with one more door to the north. In this final room, a trapped chest containing the [[Masayoshi]] legendary weapon sits on a pedestal.

## Unique Villagers

#### Sheep King Flihp Johrgenson

Sheep King Flihp Johrgenson is a merchant who runs a stall named "Flihp's Leads and Sheep Deeds", in the southwest corner of the black market. This merchant sells pieces of paper which serve as the "deed" to one of his dyed sheep found in the pens nearby, as well as very expensive leads. All deeds share the same lore text, with only the name of the sheep color varying between them:

> This deed is good for ONE (1) [Sheep Name]. All sheep are sold AS IS. If any sheep is harmed, Flihp's Leads and Sheep Deeds reserves the right to bring a civil action in the Firteid Court of Claims to recover damages equal to its value.

Of course, this being in Minecraft, players do not actually need to purchase one of these deeds to take one (or all) of this merchant's sheep, and the threat of litigation is unfortunately not within the map's current scope.

## Lore

Firteid seems to be a relatively ancient city by Drehmal's standards, likely dating back to at least the early Second Avihm, and it has effectively been the regional seat of power in the Black Jungle since that time. Firteid rose to prominence as the capital of the [[Tidal Dynasty]] under the [[Tide Queen]], a functionally immortal ruler whose rule gradually developed into a dictatorship over the course of her millennium-long lifetime. Firteid, as the capital of the Tidal Dynasty, was a very prominent force in Drehmari geopolitics of the Second Avihm, and due to its military might, was one of the few places on the continent to never be conquered by [[Avsohm]] at the empire's peak. 

After the [[Fall of Avsohm]], Firteid was relatively unaffected, not being a part of the empire, and they began to extort tourists to the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] who passed through their city, with no greater political powers to punish them. The Tide Queen's despotism took firm root in this time period, and up until the rise of [[Insohm]], she ruled with an iron fist. 

Ultimately, it would be Insohmic spies, almost certainly the Whispers, who assassinated the Tide Queen in Av3 628. Firteid fell into unrest, eventually breaking out into the [[Tidal War]], a conflict between the Tide Queen's top military leaders and the Grand Parish of Virtuo, the latter backed by Insohm. This war would culminate in the Desecration of Virtuo at the Kiln, in which [[Maelihs]] invaded and ripped out his sister's eye, ultimately leading to a victory by the Grand Parish on the back of a wave of religious fervor. This established the Parochial Enclave of Firteid, a member state of Insohm. Firteid would remain a member of Insohm until the Order's effective collapse, some 200 years later with the disappearance of Castle Hovadchear.

Today, Firteid is ruled by the Tidal Republic, an independent and more level-headed governing body, and its place as the largest city in all of eastern Drehmal gives it a very strong position in a world well past its prime.

Firteid seems to have shared a significant amount of culture with its now-ruined neighbor, the city of Vulteid. Vulteid was famed for its warriors, and at one point, was considered the spiritual capital of the Black Jungle region. However, the establishment of the Kiln of Virtuo and the growth of Firteid seem to have shifted power away from Vulteid, and it is likely that they were wiped out by soldiers of the Tidal Dynasty at some point.

One such shared tradition is Wellspring Day, a holiday that was celebrated by all the residents of Firteid and Vulteid, during the reign of the Tidal Dynasty. This massive festival included events in both towns, as described in detail by the book, [[Wellspring Day]].
