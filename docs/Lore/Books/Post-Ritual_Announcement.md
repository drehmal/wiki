## Location/Summary
This book can be found in an item frame in the [[Sepulchral Altar]]. It is not a writable book, and provides a hint as to the accepted [[Devotion]] gifts for [[Maelihs]].

## Transcription
> Attention, spectators. The Speakers of the Sepulchral Altar would like to thank you for attending today’s Ascension. On behalf of the Burnt Generals, we ask that you leave offerings at the many other statues of Maelihs throughout His domain instead of coming to the sanctum after the ritual. Thank you.
