 

This book can be found on a lectern in an underground necromantic church in the Moonspires region of [[Lorahn'Kahl]]. It is the last sermon of a necromancer, explaining why the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]] has fallen, and encouraging those who would listen to continue to pursue the Great Work.

## Transcription
> Brethren, we gather today for our final meeting below the Skullbeast's remains.
>
> In many ways, we have failed. Hundreds of the brightest lights in alchemy have been extinguished, and much of Lorahn'Kahl and the southern Tharxax plains have been ravaged by the mad rampage of our escaped Sacrificed. If Saint Raene were still with us, she would be dismayed. The Great Work remains undone.
>
> And yet, this is the way of our discipline. All alchemy is built on the blood of previous practitioners. In that respect, we have come so very far. The earliest triumphs came from Saint Raene herself. When she sat in meditation for three years on each of the first three Spheres and theorized the Necrotic Engine, a new school of alchemy was born. We put Red Dawn and its idiotic sycophantry to shame.
>
> But we did not stop there. Though brief, our experimental Tri-Moon Theocracy provided a great blueprint for a truly alchemical society. By compensating families well monetarily and with the services of the Sacrificed, they willingly gave up their children for our noble purposes. But we grew fat and complacent. With our Sacrificed attending to all needs, work on the Necrotic Engine at the Moonlight Sanctum became increasingly infrequent. And we were punished for our hubris.
>
> So I say to you now, my friends and peers, spread our story to those who will listen, and never stop pursuing the Great Work. Perhaps, then, we will convene again as gods to recreate the glorious Tri-Moon Theocracy on the moons of its namesake.
>
> Ohrah'sagaar! Don't Bend, Ascend!
