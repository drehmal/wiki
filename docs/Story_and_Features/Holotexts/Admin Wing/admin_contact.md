## Transcription:
> When Orix first made contact **beyond the tear**, we really didn’t know what to think. We had… so many questions. How did this thing get there? What are its intentions? Are the others like it, living within the **Nothing**? As Orix spoke with the entity, he became… unhinged. I don’t know why Thresa picked him to join in the **Stasis Project**; it seems to me like you’d want someone more stable to be one of those responsible for resuscitating the empire.
