**Osteogenesis** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

A chain-whip sword designed to combat the terror of the Skullbeasts, Osteogenesis is a very situational weapon, which can be extremely powerful against skeletal enemies, but is relatively weak at baseline. It is located in [[North Tharxax]].

| **Lore**                      | During the Dune Wars, Mael's Skullbeasts were a terrifying threat that could level a city in minutes. This chain-whip excretes a red bone-melting alchemical substance designed specifically to counter one. Regrettably, its inventor never got a chance to test it. |

## Gameplay
Osteogenesis is an NBT-modified iron sword, and retains that vanilla item's durability.

Osteogenesis is a unique legendary weapon in that it is relatively weak in its base attack damage, but its special ability is capable of dealing very significant damage to skeletal enemies. 

The weapon's special ability, Cleaving Maelstrom, unleashes a large AoE attack that deals significant damage to skeletal enemies (Skeletons and Chthonic Skeletons), as well as stunning other undead enemies and launching all enemies in its range. This is indicated by several rings of red particles whirling around the player. This ability activates on every third fully-charged attack that successfully lands. 

## How to Obtain
Osteogenesis is found in a somewhat hidden room in [[Fort Nimahj]].

On the town's lower level (next to a building with bunk beds and the Runic Blacksmith), there is a spruce door which seemingly leads directly into the wall. Through this door, a staircase leads down to a room with a chest containing the [[Ancient Diary]] book, as well as a wall with a centered chiseled stone bricks block. Diggging through this wall reveals a hallway and a spiral staircase, which takes the player to a small bone block structure resembling a skull. Inside of this skull is a trapped chest holding Osteogenesis.

## Lore
Osteogenesis was created in response to the threat of the Skullbeasts, monsters unleashed by [[Maelihs]] during the [[Dune Wars]] that followed shortly after the [[Fall of Avsohm]]. The Skullbeasts were large beasts made of bone, described by eyewitness reports as having exposed ribcages, which were so powerful that no mortal could possibly hope to kill one themselves, and they were effectively impossible to fight back against without the power of the Avsohmic military.

It is unclear exactly who the weapon's creator was, or if they perished before being able to test it. Fort Nimahj is the only town in the West to have never fallen under Mael's reign, so it is possible that this creator simply never had to face down a Skullbeast, and the weapon never left Nimahj's walls.
