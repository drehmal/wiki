## Transcription
> After what I saw beneath the Highfall Castle, I knew it was over. What I found was what ended Avsohm. I thought it was only myth - holes, endless holes, consuming and encompassing all.
>
> I had to write down everything I found before I went mad. This... creature, I'll call it the Gaping Hole. It kills with its glare, turning anything it wishes into Nothing. It invaded Avsohm's most secretive places and destroyed them from the inside out, killing any and all that witnessed it.
>
> The monster is clearly driven by some higher power, but what? It's simple minded and seems to go wherever it pleases, but it's gone now. Otherwise we'd all be dead.
