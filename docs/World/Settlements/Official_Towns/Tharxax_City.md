# Tharxax City

![[tharxax_city.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Tharxax City** is a city in [[South Tharxax]], located at the eastern end of the inland sea in western Drehmal. It is accessible by a brick road, which leads north towards [[Fort Nimahj]] or south towards the ruins of Semehol and [[Lorahn'Kahl]]. The South Tharxax [[Terminus Network#Towers|Tower]] is located on a small island due west of the city.

Tharxax City is very industrial, with standardized buildings made of cobblestone, stone bricks, spruce wood, and bricks, laid out on a neat city grid with clearly labeled brick roads. It is one of the larger towns in Drehmal, both in population and land area.

Entering Tharxax City for the first time grants the "WUPOM (Wealthy Under Protection of Mael)" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[tharxax_city_map.png]]{ width="400" }
> The in-game map of Tharxax City.

The majority of Tharxax City is located on the tip of a small peninsula, with signs clearly marking each individual building and street. Two buildings stand out, however: the Lord Magister's Residence, on the archway that overlooks the rest of the city and which the path to the city goes under; and Ohmswil's Emporium, the tower of an [[Arcanism|arcanist]] to the south of the rest of town.

### Lord Magister's Residence

The home of the Lord Magister, a nobleman in service of [[Maelihs]] who effectively governs over Tharxax City, at the top of the arch overlooking Tharxax City from the east. Entering this structure for the first time grants the "Lofty Laboratory" advancement under the Discoveries/Landmarks tab, and there are multiple notable things to be found here.

On the bottom floor, the [[Tharhan A Land of Conquest (Chapter 2)|Tharhan: A Land of Conquest (Chapter 2)]] book is found, high on a bookshelf, which tells the story of the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]] and their unification under [[Caer Adacia]].

On the second floor, the [[AvPOD]] legendary item sits on a table.

A [[Runic Catalyst]] can also be found here, on the outside of the building.

### Ohmswil's Emporium

A tower just south of Tharxax City, Ohmswil's Emporium, is the home of Master Arcanist Ohmswil, a trader who deals primarily in exclusive joke items.

On the ground floor, a purple carpet can be broken to reveal a trapdoor, and a ladder that leads down to a dark, hidden room. This room contains the [[Forbidden Bones]] book, whose author writes about using the magically charged bones of fallen arcanists to kill other arcanists, making it their goal to eradicate the practice entirely. Presumably, this book was written by the only inhabitant of the tower, meaning that Ohmswil is actually a master arcanist dedicated to hunting and killing other arcanists.

### Tharxax Markethouse

The Tharxax Markethouse is located in the southeastern portion of the city proper, with 5 permanent unique merchants residing either in the building or just outside of it. The town's in-game map is also found outside this building, at the corner of Greybison Way and Trade Street. 

Inside the Markethouse itself, an iron door protects the Tharxax City Treasury, which contains multiple mineral blocks and the [[Scarred Notepad]] book.

### The Groggy Greybison

A bar located in eastern Tharxax City, at 6 Uhlder Avenue. The [[BIG News!]] book is found here.

### Slime Factory

The Slime Factory is located in southern Tharxax City, at 31 Slime Street. Here, a family business processed the slime that was harvested from the Slime Island to the city's east, which was refined in Semehol.

### Gohson's Bunkhouse

Gohson's Bunkhouse, the town's inn, is located in the southwest, at 30 Slime Street. The Primal Cache room is room 1C, on the second floor.

### Arghelin Mining Company

A building in southwestern Tharxax City at 14 Greybison Way, containing some ores and mineral blocks.

## Lore

Tharxax city is an [[Insohm|Insohmic]]-era city, built in the location of the original capital of the First Tharhan Empire, Elthun. The Tharhan Plains were one of the first places to be settled in early Av2 after the [[Felling]], being one of the first places made livable again by [[Drehmal]]'s reformation efforts, and it grew to be one of the largest centers of power in Av2. After the collapse of the First Tharhan Empire, Tharhan split into [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six warring states]], with Elthun likely becoming part of Erxsival. It would remain a part of this kingdom until [[Casai]] invaded and [[Caer Adacia]] became the regional seat of power, bringing about the [[Second Tharhan Empire]].

Tharxax City was a part of this Second Tharhan Empire, which was then subjugated by [[Avsohm]].

Tharxax City as it exists today was built in the Insohmic era, in mid-late Av3, several centuries after the [[Fall of Avsohm]]. It was likely part of the territory that initially fell to [[Maelihs]] in the [[Dune Wars]], was liberated by Insohm, and then fell back to the [[Empire of Maelihs]] after the Order's collapse some 200 years before the main story. Today, Tharxax City's residents largely consider themselves to be under the protection of the Burnt Lord, but occasionally questioning the [[Maelmari]] worldview that they have been taught, as seen in some of the town's lore books.

Tharxax City seems to have made a name for itself through industry, particularly mining and the processing/export of slime from the nearby Slime Island, as well as general commerce.
