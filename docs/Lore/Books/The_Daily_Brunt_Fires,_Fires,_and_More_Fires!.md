## Transcription
> On the eastern side of Rhaveloth, multiple fires have sprung up, from a shack atop the critically acclaimed The Black Tree Restaurant and Bar to a small stairwell. Both have been in poorer residents homes, a rumor (that I'm making up) says that there may just be more than meets the eye...

> Perhaps it's a cold-hearted arsonist (ha), possibly a debt collector gone astray, or maybe even the very person reading this paper! Or just two numbskulls who don't know how to keep a torch. You decide, dear reader! Leave your notes with your payment in the chest as you leave the courtyard please! :)
