## Transcription
> **The Heartwood:**
>
> To the East, across the river, lies the dense and dangerous forest known as the Heartwood. Come prepared both in mind and in equipment before journeying here.
>
> **Merijool Forest:**
>
> A serene autumnal peninsula filled with wildlife. Quite the trek from here. Consider stocking up on supplies before making the journey.
>
> **Akhlo'Rohma:**
>
> A gorgeous land of massive flowers with the crown jewel of Dusps at its center. Also considerably far, and pillagers may guard the path. Come with weapons.
>
> **Palisades Heath:**
>
> Massive cliffs and deep fjords to the south across the Capital River. Bridges may or may not be in complete disrepair. A huge pillager camp lies along the road, perhaps with treasure fit for any adventurer.
>
> **Other Notes:**
>
> Roads in Drehmal are old and decrepit, fading out after some time. One is forced off the beaten path to survive.
