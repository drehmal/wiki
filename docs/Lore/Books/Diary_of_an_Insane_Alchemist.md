## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Skeveraan Laboratory]] in southwest [[Spearhead Forest]], written by the insane alchemist who inhabits the building and presumably kidnapped many of the residents of [[Helmshire]].

## Transcription
> They all called me insane. They all did! But I was the only one who could see the truth. That's why I had to build this... my dream home. Here, I could work in secret, away from all those pesky villagers. At least I've found another use for them.
