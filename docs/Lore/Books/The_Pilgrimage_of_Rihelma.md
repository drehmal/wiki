This book can be found on a lectern in the orrery building atop the [[Rihelma's Domain|Aldregakar]]. It describes the prophetic capabilities of the [[Rihelma|Sky Aspect]], and establishes that she can commune with those beyond the Veil when on [[Lo'Veruhkt]], the hidden moon. However, Rihelma has now not been seen for a very long time, and her devotees fear for the future without her foresight.

## Transcription
> For many years (longer than the reckoning of any Tehrmari) Rihelma has made pilgrimage to Lo'Veruhkt in order to commune with those beyond the veil. Her unparalleled talent in augury has made her known throughout many realms beyond ours. Beings of great stature, many of which dwarf even the Deities, came to Our Lady for advice. This was an acceptable state of affairs, to be sure, but that state has since been broken. Rihelma has left us, and shuns all who approach. Indeed, it is in her right to do so, but I fear great repercussions. Even now, there are reports from across the realm of malevolent whispers in both the dreaming and waking worlds. I fear for the future of our realm if we were to attract a malign will or the attention of a being of great power.
