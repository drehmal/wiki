## Transcription
> If reality is a deserted island, then there are three types of castaway.
>
> The first, and wisest, would carefully gather resources while persisting off as few as possible, and learn to farm and fish until being able to live comfortably and sustainably.
>
> The second would simply indulge in the islandâ€™s resources to depletion, finding happiness before expiring on their own terms.
>
> And the third, and most foolish, would build a raft with all the resources aboard in vain hope of finding more happiness elsewhere before being dashed to pieces against the waves.

## Extras
This book seems to very closely parallel some of the [[End-Game_Dialogue.md|end-game dialogue]] given by a [[yellow|mysterious, powerful figure]].
