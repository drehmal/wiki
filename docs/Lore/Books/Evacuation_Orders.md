## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in [[Mt. Yavhlix]], written by [[Orix Cehein]] to all staff at the facility.

## Transcription
> To all Yavhlix personnel: We are to begin evacuation tomorrow morning. We detected massive fluctuations in energy coming from the anomaly, conditions are now unsafe for all non-essential personnel. If you are designated as essential, you will be notified individually.
>
> Standard operations will resume when fluctuations return to safe levels. Please do not be alarmed. This is a precautionary measure and we expect operation to resume in a few days' time. A temporary base camp has been established immediately outside the facility for personnel to remain at while operations are suspended. Thank you for your patience and time.
