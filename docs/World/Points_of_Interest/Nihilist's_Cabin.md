# Nihilist's Cabin

![[nihilist_cabin.png]]

The **Nihilist's Cabin** (1) is a small structure in the northeastern [[Frozen Bite]], heavily involved in the quest for the [[Oblivion]] mythical weapon. The Compass of Nihility found beneath [[Highfall]] leads here, and the Nihilist's Notes found here lead to [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. The location is also home to multiple notable lore books, concerned with the horrifying forces that destroyed [[Avsohm]].

## Oblivion Questline

After following the tunnel beneath the castle in [[Highfall]], players will be rewarded with a Compass of Nihility, calibrated to this location. Following it, they will arrive at the cabin. The lodestone that this compass is calibrated to is exposed, and finding it will lead to the next clue.

??? warning "Lodestone Location"
    The lodestone is located in the attic of the cabin, along with the Nihilist's Notes.

## Lore

The person living in this cabin saw something beneath Highfall Castle, and was driven insane by this knowledge, believing it to be the creature that [[Fall of Avsohm|killed the Avsohmic Empire]]. There are two very notable lore books found in this cabin:

- [[Creature of Nothing]] on the second floor, which describes this monster, calling it the "Gaping Hole". <br>
- [[The Pawn]], asserting that there must be another "pawn" of the higher being controlling the Gaping Hole, responsible for ripping out pages of sensitive Avsohmic documents and erasing some of the empire's forbidden knowledge.

Both of these figures do come up again, and were indeed involved in the fall of Avsohm.
