> I have had enough. My son is dead. My wife is dead. My parents are dead. My friends are dead. Their friends are dead. Our traditions are dead. Our crops are dead. Our animals are dead. And I will be dead soon, too. This place is nothing but a graveyard now. If you’re reading this and are Gozaki or from one of Insohm’s puppet armies, I curse you to watch as everyone you love is destroyed before dying slowly from a gut wound carved by the queen’s Masayoshi.
