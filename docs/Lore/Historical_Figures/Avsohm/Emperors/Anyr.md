1. An official timeline from [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1]] gives the date of Anyr's coronation as Av2 1761, although this timeline is no longer officially referenced anywhere and no date is given in the current version of the map.

**Uffeihl Anyr** (pronounced "oof-ale an-ear") (imperial title: Anyr Kalkorahm Al'Drehn Avsohm I), often referred to simply as **Anyr**, was an aristocrat and general, who later served as the third and final emperor of [[Avsohm]], directly succeeding [[Ifeihl|Zorhis Ifeihl]]. 

Anyr oversaw what many in Avsohm saw as a second golden age, progressing the empire's technology and military power even further, but also significantly cracked down on free speech and artistic expression, turning Avsohm into a markedly more authoritarian state. 

In Av2 1820, Anyr's reign was abruptly cut short by the events that caused the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's fall]], and he is presumed to have died on that fateful day.

## Appearance

Anyr's official reference sheet is not public, but some art from the dev team is, clearly showing his physical appearance.

Anyr is depicted as a tall, thin, middle-aged man with tan skin, dark but graying hair, and very sharp features. His ears are long, pointed, and angled slightly downwards, away from his thick matte black horns, which are in turn decorated with golden engravings. He is depicted with lots of golden accessories, including ear piercings and armor, as well as a red cape in his imperial regalia.

## Characteristics

Anyr is possibly the single most well-characterized figure in the map. 

He is depicted as a very proud and ostentatious man, a confident and natural-born leader. An authoritative and gifted orator, he was also surprisingly soft-spoken in person.

Anyr's greatest wish, above all else, was to fill the shoes of the first emperor of Avsohm, [[Drehn]], and even to eventually exceed his accomplishments. While this may have begun as a noble desire, it seems that it may have become a deep-seated insecurity for Anyr, always feeling like he had to take one more step to prove he was better than the founder.

## History

### Nobility and Military Career

Anyr's family was part of a noble house within Avsohm, who were appointed to control the lands of [[Anyr'Nogur]] and [[South Tharxax]] following the empire's annexation of the [[Second Tharhan Empire]] under [[Drehn]]'s reign. House Anyr governed from the desert metropolis of Azen'nath, a Casain settlement in the Golden Sands which was renamed to Sal'Iloh under Avsohmic rule.

Anyr himself was a well-respected general in the Avsohmic military during the reign of Ifeihl, reportedly involved in conflicts in the continent's far northeast, possibly referring to either the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] or war with the Kingdom of [[Highfall]].

Avsohm's actions under Ifeihl were widely criticized, as the Emperor was seen as soft and unfit to lead such a massive state. In particular, Ifeihl's mishandling of the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], which resulted in hordes of undead roaming the land, was seen as the final straw, and Ifeihl was pressured to step down. Anyr, a military hero and a well-respected leader, was nominated to be the third Emperor, and an unsatisfied populace was swayed by his campaign.

The [[Emperor Anyr's Scepter]] legendary is a relic of this time, when Anyr carried a weaponized staff on his person at all times.

### Early Reign

Anyr was crowned as the new emperor shortly after Ifeihl stepped down, with accounts conflicting on his method of selection. He is said to have won the popular vote in an election, but another book written by [[Kahmas Tuhs|a higher-up]] in [[Blue Exodus]] suggests that Anyr was actually chosen by a committee.

Anyr's first act as emperor was to move his cabinet to [[Sal'Anyr]], the former metropolis of Azen'nath, which was now well in the process of being assimilated into Avsohmic culture. As part of his militaristic overhaul of Avsohm, Anyr turned Sal'Anyr into a military stronghold for the empire, gearing up for an anticipated war with the forces of [[Maelihs]] to the south.

Anyr was known to have cracked down on the arts, particularly more abstract forms of art that blossomed under Ifeihl. His cabinet is implied to have threatened artists who did not comply to this change, with most of them pivoting to art that directly glorified Anyr, Drehn, [[Drehmal]], and [[Virtuo]].

Over the course of his reign, Anyr also won over favor and continuously centralized power. Favoring Centralist policies over the Regionalists, Anyr effectively painted himself as the ultimate strongman, and won over the vast majority of the empire's population with his cult of personality. This can be seen in many places, such as the statue of Anyr holding up [[disc|the world]] in [[Av'Sal]].

### Project Apotheosis

In his later years, however, Anyr grew even more power-hungry, and the discoveries that Avsohm made in their final decades would lead to his true legacy.

The deployment of the Resonant Eye in the [[Resonant Halls]] and the subsequent discovery of [[Tethlaen]] in the [[Nothing]] was a massive revelation for Avsohm's top officials, as they learned that they were, in fact, only one of several billion realms. They grew more and more ambitious in their projects, forging the [[Mythbreaker]] from what they perceived to be its outline in one of the dives.

While some others were shocked at the revelation that they were far from alone in the universe or even mortified by how small they were on a cosmic scale, Anyr saw this as an opportunityâ€”an opportunity for expansion. Desperately wishing to match the legacy of Drehn Mal'Sohm, Anyr began instructing his top scientists and advisors to devise a plan to spread Avsohm to the stars.

This plan would take the form of Project Apotheosis, a massive undertaking across all the empire's top agencies. [[Red Dawn]] was to construct a machine capable of turning Anyr into a god, completing the elusive alchemical [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]] in their headquarters of [[Azimuth Labs]]. [[Blue Exodus]] quietly built up a secret collection of high-tech weaponry that they would use to storm the [[Hellcrags]], ridding the empire of [[Maelihs]] once and for all. The Avsohmic [[Avsohm#Department of Science|DoS]] was tasked with finding a suitable stockpile of [[Primal Energy]] to charge the Mythbreaker, which they would use to tear a hole in the [[Veil]] from the [[Aphelion]].

Parts of this plan were indeed implemented. Beginning around the 75% mark, players will start to see mentions of Anyr referring to him as "God-Emperor Anyr", a title that apparently became common in his later years. Worship of Anyr became the norm within the empire, even further polarizing some against him.

Project Apotheosis was put on indefinite hold, however, due to the issue of charging the Mythbreaker. Using the tear at [[Mt. Yavhlix]] would almost certainly collapse the energy grid for the entire continent, and their other option, the [[Numencore]], would incur the wrath of [[Khive|Mystic Elder Khive]]. Avsohm continued to bide their time, waiting until the God Machine was ready to ascend Anyr, so that he could do battle with Khive, Maelihs, and any other higher beings that might stand in their way.

This plan was not enacted as initially intended. On the day that would be the empire's fall, the God Machine was activated, and claimed to succeed, but Anyr died on its throne regardless. The other facilities, not expecting the machine to be activated, lost power and were isolated from one another, as mysterious forces crept into the realm to [[Fall of Avsohm|punish the empire for its hubris]]. 

Anyr's corpse would sit atop the God Machine for over a thousand years, where he is found in the end-game sequence.
