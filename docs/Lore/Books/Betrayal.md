## Transcription
> So it’s true after all. Fencur did steal our golden carrot! Me and Skili didn’t want to believe it. It’s not often that we get such tasty treats, and almost every time we do they wind up missing. But what is to be done? Fencur always livens up any Kindling Day celebration, and the kids love to hear his stories. And yet, the last time he was over, he took property rightfully owned by us for what must be the third time!
>
> Could we report him to the Guard? We know what he’s doing with all the stuff he takes. Only reason we knew for sure it was him was that Skili caught a glimpse of a golden carrot in the Drehmari work yard. Fencur’s always spouting on and on about how we need to listen and hear others instead of just getting loud and saying what we already know. He just can't leave those witch-cursed smoothskins alone. Radiance knows I should alert the Guard. But can I do that to the kids? I saw them bobbing on his knee and playing with his beard last night when he stole our prized dessert. And I saw the half-smile touch Skili’s lips.

> Lord Maelihs has not roused the troops for war since the witch fled this realm. Maybe, just this once, I should also bide my time before acting. I have more mouths to help feed now. And I enjoy Fencur’s handiwork. There's no finer woodworker in the Crimson Oasis! At the very least, it will need to be a discussion when Skili comes home from work.
