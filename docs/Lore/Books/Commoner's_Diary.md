This book can be found in a chest in [[Xor'Huul]]. It paints a picture of the final days of the kingdom of Xor'Huul, after a mysterious plague began to quickly kill off the city's priests. This caused the nobles to attempt to barricade themselves in, resulting in a clash between the commoners and nobility that killed off the entirety of the city's population through direct conflict or infection.

> The deaths of most of our priests to this mysterious plague have sent the nobles panicking. Against King Xhuthro's wishes, they've taken matters into their own hands by hoarding food and materials, then barricading the royal quarters off from us commoners. You know, I was never one to be naive about where the nobles' motives lie. But now that this is all unfolding before us, I still find it hard to believe. Perhaps I was naive after all.

> Our own food supplies have shrunk to nearly nothing, and the commoners are growing agitated. The noblemen have abandoned us, leaving us to die from either the plague, or to my greater concern, each other. I can already see the desperation in the eyes of many, it's only a matter of time until it gets even worse.

> Arhzo said he was going to organize a group of men in an attempt to storm the barricades. From the moment I heard his plan, I knew blood would be shed. It's a terrible idea, and yet, I feel no other option but to join them. It's either that or a slow death at this point.

> Oh, Koh be with me, it was a bloodbath. The royal guards... they didn't even hesitate. They seemed to not even see us as their countrymen. Arhzo was the first to fall... the cowards shot him in the back. He was not the only one, and nearly everyone has been wounded, myself included.  But, miraculously, we won. The guards were weak, surprisingly so. Many looked-half dead from the plague already. And then we saw it. The king on his throne, gasping for breath, dying. He was entirely covered in stone and gem, hardly fit to be called a Drehmari. None of us are fit to lead; indeed, we are all afflicted with the same curse as he. The king has failed us, and Xor'huul has fallen.
