## Location/Summary
This book can be found on a lectern atop the [[Old Insohmic Library]]. Its author writes that the Insohmic attempt to re-open [[Mt. Yavhlix]]'s gate has failed, and wonders how to break the news to [[Vahid|Master Vahid]].

## Transcription
> I have heard word from the excavation effort at Mt. Yavhlix in northwest Faehrcyle. They have officially suspended operations. Master Vahid won’t be happy at all. I’ll need to talk to him in public; he's less likely to be in one of his moods when the realm is watching. I'll also need to pair it with some good news. Maybe the alchemy division has figured something out. I hope so, or I might be the newest frontline trooper in the Carmine!
