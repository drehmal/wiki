## Use

Fervor Stones are used to upgrade [Mythical Weapons](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/) at the Soletta, the fabled forge in [[Ytaj]] behind the Prismatic Council room. 

![[soletta.png]]

Stones can be placed on the bottom block by right-clicking, and a Mythical Weapon can be placed on the top level block by right-clicking as well. When both are in place, the button at the front of the forge can be pressed to upgrade the weapon.

After the upgrade, one of the three empty brackets on the weapon's description will be filled in by the symbol of the respective stone: [α], [β], or [Δ]. 

The effect of the upgrade is determined by the kind of stone used. 

Stones of Agony reduce the mythical weapon's cooldown time by 25% permanently.

Stones of Luxury add a permanent +4 Max Health (+2 Hearts) buff to the mythical weapon when held, adding to any existing max health penalty or bonus. For example, a weapon with a -6 Max Health penalty at baseline will have a penalty of only -2 Max Health after this stone is applied, and a weapon with no bonus at baseline will grant +4 Max Health after upgraded.

Stones of Worry add a permanent +0.01 Movement Speed to the mythical weapon when held, adding to existing bonuses or penalties in the same manner as Stones of Luxury.

Only one type of each Fervor Stone may be applied to a given weapon: it is not possible to, for instance, stack three Stones of Worry onto a single mythical.

## Extras
There are exactly enough Fervor Stones in the map to upgrade all 8 Mythical weapons, so losing or accidentally destroying one (which can occur at the Soletta through known, but rare bugs) could lock the player out of fully upgrading all Mythicals. 

In this scenario, there are commands to give a player any of the three Fervor Stones:
