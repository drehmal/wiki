## Transcription
> My name is Guhstav, and I like things BIG. Bigger is better, as far as I’m concerned, so I’ve traveled all over the land looking for the largest trees, mountains, buildings, infrastructure, you name it.
>
> I just came back from Rhaveloth, and I'd say that the walls there are definitely some of the biggest I’ve seen. Bigger than the ones around Fort Nimahj, certainly, although not as tall or detailed as Maehrn'Vhos.
>
> I wasn’t able to get as close as I would have liked due to the less-than-friendly locals, but their
imposing wooden facade was still quite a sight to behold.
>
> And with that, my list of southwestern features is nearly finished! My next destination is Akhlo'Rohma to the far northeast of the continent. I've heard that there are flowers there that
are taller than most trees and gigantic, mysterious pipes which are suspended above the ground and lead through the northern mountains into Faehrcyle.
