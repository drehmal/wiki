This book can be found on a lectern in the now-overgrown Hydroponics Lab section of the [[Aphelion]]. It contains an overview of this wing of the Aphelion's contents, including a small farm area, biological materials from [[Lo'Dahr]], and seed samples from several different species in an effort at conservationism.

> -------------------
> OVERVIEW:
>
> Although significant quantities of edible rations can be imported via the Terminus, Drehmari aboard the Aphelion have reported a decline in taste from between the source (mostly farms located in the Capital Valley region) and the station. For this reason, some resources within the Biology Wing are dedicated to supplementary food production. Within this wing, the following crops should be maintained at all times:
>
> -Carrots
> -Beetroot
> -Potatoes
> -Wheat
> -Sweetberry
> -Sugar Cane

> Section 2: Lo'Dahr Research Materials
> -------------------
> OVERVIEW:
>
> Ever since Avsohmic ships first touched down on the surface of the Divine Moon, biologists have obtained samples of the local flora and fauna. Although not all of the plants found on Lo'Dahr are compatible with soil from Drehmal, those which are compatible are maintained by the Aphelion Biology Wing for study by researchers in this facility. Right now, these include:
>
> "Khivan Roots"
>
> "Rihel Roots"
>
> "Ghelshrooms"
>
> "Dahrshrooms"
>
> Section 3: Project InfiniteAV
> -------------------
> OVERVIEW:
>
> As the custodian of the Drehmari race, God-Emperor Anyr has personally ordered the Aphelion Biology Wing to keep samples and seeds of the most important plant species from Drehmal as well as sperm and ova from the most important animal species (including sperm and ova from Drehmari).
>
> Although most of these are stored behind strict lock and key, some rare strains of macroflora are kept in the biodome.
> These include:
> -An Akhlo'rose
> -A Chthonic Rose
> -A Heartwood Mahogany
> -A Veldt Acacia
> -A Tehrmian Aspen
> -A Merioak
> -A Spearhead Spruce
