## Transcription
> Some smug dignitary from Ancehl has decided to grace us humble members of parliament with his presence. Infuriating how they think they can still trample over us despite the recent reforms. The Duke was agreeable enough, but now he's dead and his scheming vizier is in his place. I've been told those northern nobles have been reduced to hiring Maelmari mercenaries to bolster their security. Maybe they're right to be afraid; tensions are running ever higher.
