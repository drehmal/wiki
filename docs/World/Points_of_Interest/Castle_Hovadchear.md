Today, the location is still only a crater, with a single structure at its northern end. This structure holds one evoker named "The Mourner", as well as a tomb dedicated to Hovadchear. This tomb contains the [[Hovadchear's Greathammer]] legendary weapon.

Hovadchear's grave bears two signs, which read: <br>
> Rest In Peace <br>
> Hovadchear Myrik <br>
> Companion of Ultva Utofal <br>

> Bastion of Truths <br>
> Founder of the Order of Insohm

## Lore

Castle Hovadchear served as the capital of [[Insohm]] from the time that it was founded as the Insohmic Coalition by Hovad and [[Ultva]], up until the castle's mysterious disappearance.[^1]

It is not known what caused the vanishing of the castle, although several potential culprits have been suggested. These include [[yellow|an extremely powerful end-game character]], the bizarre monsters seen around the time of [[Fall of Avsohm|Avsohm's demise]], and more, but no answers have been found.

[^1]: Some sources are conflicted on whether Castle Hovadchear or Old [[Mossfield]] was the true capital of Insohm. Both locations were central to the Order.
