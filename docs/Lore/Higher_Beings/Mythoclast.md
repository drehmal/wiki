# Mythoclast

The Mythoclast is the most poweful being in the universe, and the judge of all dead/unborn souls. Despite their immense power, they may be mortal due to the fact that they felt threatened by the advances of [Emperor Anyr[Uffhiel Anyr]] of [Avsohm[Empire of Avsohm]]. The Mythoclast has directly interfered in the history of Drehmal's realm.

## Characteristics

The Mythoclast's true form cannot be perceived by lesser beings, but they appear as a golden serpentine dragon. Their name also induces an overwhelming, dizzy sensation upon being realized for the first time. The Mythoclast has neither a good nor evil demeanor.

## Capabilities

The Mythoclast possesses an extreme degree of power, with little limit as to what they are able to do. During the story, the Mythoclast demonstrates their ability to effortlessly blast through veilstone, bend runic technology to their will, teleport anyone anywhere and preserve the life of people as puppets. They are also known to be able to conjure up twisted creatures that consume anything, and they might be able to directly cause things to instantly vanish.

The Mythoclast decides the destiny of all souls when they pass through the [[Court of Nothing]] on their way from death to rebirth.

## In [Drehmal[Drehmal (Place)]]'s History

When Avsohmic scientists discovered what was believed to be an image of a weapon through the Resonant Eye, they knew that it must be the creation of an intelligent entity. They named this figure "Him-Beyond", and Emperor Anyr devises a plan to overthrow this being and expand the Empire of Avsohm throughout the universe's many realms. This plot relied on the forging of the weapon ("[[Mythbreaker]]"), a catalyst of unforseen power with the ability to breach the Veil, and the creation of the "God Machine" to grant Anyr power akin to that of the Aspects. Mythbreaker was completed in its unpowered form, and the God Machine was activated, resulting in an initial success. The Mythbreaker was angered, and to thoroughly eradicate any threat of opposition, they immediately deployed a legion of beasts that destroyed most of Avsohm (both structures and people) with perfectly circular holes. Drehn Mal'Sohm was present to witness the [empire's fall[Fall of Avsohm]] in accordance with his soul's wish to the Mythoclast in the [[Court of Nothing]]. He appeared shrouded in a purple cloak and wielding the scythe [[Oblivion]]. However, the Avsohmic stasis crew was left untouched.

In the Third Avihm, the [[Order of Insohm]] began heavily researching Avsohmic technology with hopes of recreating it and using it to achieve the same dominance over the [[Empire of Maelihs]] that Avsohm had. The Mythoclast decides to take a precautious measure and by some means makes Insohm's headquarters, [Castle Hovadchear[Castle Hovadchear Crater], disappear along with [Master Hovadchear[Hovadchear Myrik]] (the Order's founder) himself. Shortly after, they possess [Master Ultva[Ultva Utofal]], the co-founder, who locks himself inside of an Avsohmic vault.

## Role in Story

After defeating [[Tethlaen]] and returning to Drehmal, a mysterious voice (shown as "???") begins to speak to the player in chat. They override [[avSYS]]'s compass dispensary to give the player three trinkets in total, which guide the player to [[Azimuth Labs]], then the [[Resonant Halls]], and finally to the [[Stasis Facility]]. At the first two locations, the player receives details on Anyr's machinations with the Resonant Eye and God Machine from holotexts and additional information provided by the voice in chat. At the Stasis Facility, the unnamed figure reveals their identity as the Mythoclast. They gift the player [[The Mythbreaker]] and teleport them to the Court of Nothing to fight Ultva and Hovadchear, who are kept alive and under the Mythoclast's control. After the battle, the player is teleported to the [[Maddened Path], at the end of which the player confronts a boss known as the Emissary of the Void. The boss is revealed to be [[Drehn Mal'Sohm]], the first emperor of Avsohm, upon reaching his second phase. Once he is defeated, he is killed by his own scythe. The Mythoclast explains that Drehn's soul wished to see the end of his empire as he visited the Court of Nothing. To grant his wish, Drehn was kept alive by the Mythoclast until now to see the player, the final living Avsohmic Drehmari. The Mythoclast now allows the player to return to Drehmal, which has since been transformed into a vast, empty desert due to the time dilation experienced at the Heart of the Void. When the player finds Drehmal's skeleton, the Mythoclast explains the fates of the Aspects, [[Virtuo]], [[Maelihs]] and [[Drehmal]]. They then offer to let the player die.
