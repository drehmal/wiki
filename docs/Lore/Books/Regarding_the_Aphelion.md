## Transcription
> This is a report compiling all known information about the Aphelion and is to be delivered to Rhalon, the First Burnt General.
>
> The airship known as the Aphelion was constructed by the Avsohmic Empire and is considered to be the crown jewel of Avsohm's fleets.
>
> The Aphelion was kept secret to the public and its existence is only known today because of spies.
>
> It is said that an untold wealth of knowledge and powerful technology lies aboard it. It is believed that it is able to travel extremely long distances without needing to resupply, which assumes that Avsohm used their warp technology to keep the engine running and the food plentiful.
>
> It was designed as a research vessel to study something. What it was studying is up for debate.
>
> Rhalon has ordered the discovery of this vessel to be a top priority and is assembling fleets to scour the seas for its wreckage.
