> Oh. My. Gosh. Siri Heipan just got a new red rose bush. This is a blatant violation of the neighborhood code. Let me just list a few reasons why she has ruined our whole community:
>
> - She waters that thing every day, taking away our ability to drink and bathe our children.
>
> - It is so garish. No one will ever want to live in this part of town anymore.
>
> - It is dangerous. One of her kids, or one of OUR kids is going to impale themselves on its asinine thorns.
>
> - She cut down a beautiful little mahogany to put that thing in. That could have been a stunning tree someday.
>
> - She just wonâ€™t stop talking about that stupid thing.
>
> - Rose bushes might have been in last year, but they are OUT now!!!!
>
> I am seriously considering going over in the middle of the night and chopping it down, so help me Goddess!
