## Summary
**The Mythoclast** (known to Avsohm as "Him-Beyond" and often informally referred to by the Drehmal ommunity as "Mytho," "Mr. O'Clast," or "Yellow") is the most powerful known being in the universe of Drehmal. Referring to himself as the "titanic power at the center of creation," he is implied to be the ruler of all existence, including innumerable other realms besides Drehmal. He first appears to the player upon completion of the [[Mt. Yavhlix]] dungeon as a disembodied voice, speaking with the name **"???"**. His first words to the player indicate the start of the end-game.

Although his influence is often hidden, The Mythoclast plays a central role in the story of Drhemal, having directly intervened in the realm's history by personally smiting the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]], as well as functioning as the player's guide through the post-game sequence containing several revelations about the history of Avsohm and what ultimately spelled their doom.

## Appearance

The Mythoclast's true material form cannot be perceived by lesser beings, but he presents the player with a mural that purports to capture his approximate image. This mural (pictured below) shows the form of a golden, serpentine dragon. His true name also induces an overwhelming, dizzy sensation upon being heard by mortal ears for the first time.

## Abilities

The Mythoclast possesses an extreme degree of power, with little limit as to what he is able to do. During the story, the Mythoclast demonstrates his ability to effortlessly blast through veilstone, bend runic technology to his will, teleport anyone anywhere, and preserve deceased mortals as puppets, controlling a functionally endless army of higher beings. Although not confirmed, it also appears that The Mythoclast has the ability to cause large strutures to disappear entirely, as he is the primary suspect for the disappearance of [[Castle Hovadchear]].

The Mythoclast decides the destiny of all souls when they pass through [[Court of Nothing|his Court]] on their way from death to rebirth.

## In Drehmal's History

When Avsohmic scientists discovered what was believed to be an image of a weapon through the Resonant Eye, they deduced that it must be the creation of an intelligent entity. They named this figure "Him-Beyond", and Emperor Anyr devised a plan to overthrow this being and expand the Empire of Avsohm throughout the universe's many realms. This plot relied on the forging of the weapon ("[[Mythbreaker]]"), a catalyst of unforseen power with the ability to breach the Veil, and the creation of the "God Machine" to grant Anyr power akin to that of the Aspects. Mythbreaker was completed in its unpowered form, and the God Machine was activated, resulting in an initial success. The Mythoclast was angered, and to thoroughly eradicate any threat of opposition, he struck down Anyr and immediately deployed a legion of beasts (known as "Those Beyond") that destroyed most of Avsohm (both structures and people) with perfectly circular holes. He then sent his Pawn, the [[Emissary of the Void]], to sabotage the Avsohmic [[Stasis Facility]].

In the Third Avihm, the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] began heavily researching Avsohmic technology with hopes of recreating it and using it to achieve the same dominance over the [[Empire of Maelihs]] that Avsohm had. In a precautious measure, the Mythoclast by some means made Insohm's headquarters, [[Castle Hovadchear]], disappear along with [[Hovadchear|Master Hovadchear]] (the Order's founder) himself, leaving only a massive crater. The whereabouts of the castle today, if it still exists anywhere, is unknown.

## In-Game

After defeating [[Tethlaen]] and returning to Drehmal, a mysterious voice (shown as three yellow question marks, "???") begins to speak to the player in chat. It overrides [[avSYS]]'s compass dispensary to give the player three trinkets in total, which guide the player respectively to [[Azimuth Labs]], then the [[Resonant Halls]], and finally back to the [[Stasis Facility]] (leading to the [[Court of Nothing]]). At the first two locations, the player receives details on Anyr's machinations with the Resonant Eye and God Machine from holotexts and additional information provided by the voice. At the Stasis Facility, the unnamed figure reveals his identity as the Mythoclast. He gifts the player a stronger version of the [[Mythbreaker]] and teleports them to the Court of Nothing to fight [[Ultva]] and [[Hovadchear]], who have been kept alive and under the Mythoclast's control. After the battle, the player is teleported to the [[Heart of the Void]], the center of the Mythoclast's domain. The end of this area sees the player fight The Emissary of the Void, revealed to be Avsohmic founder [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], who is ultimately defeated by the player. The Mythoclast explains that Drehn's soul wished to see the end of his empire, and to grant his wish, Drehn was kept alive by the Mythoclast until now to see the player, the final living remnant of Avsohm. The Mythoclast then takes the player back to Drehmal for the very last sequence of the game, in which he explains the ultimate fates of the realm's Aspects and Deities, before offering the player closure.

## Identity

The true identity of the Mythoclast has been the source of intense speculation within the Drehmal community, as many have entertained the idea that he may have been born mortal, but managed to ascend to his current level of omnipotence, potentially through completion of the [[Ambition]]. It has been theorized that if this is the case, then the Mythoclast may even be a known figure from the realm of Drehmal, as he seems to take a particular interest in our realm.

Many characters have been proposed as potential candidates for the original identity of the Mythoclast, although none of these theories have been confirmed by developers or reached any sort of consensus among the community. Such characters include [[Verrhys]], [[Akim]], and [[Aok]], to name a few.
