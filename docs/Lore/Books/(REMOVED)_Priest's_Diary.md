# (Removed) - Priest's Diary
## Note: This book is removed content, which does not appear in the current version of the map (1.20.1). It is still on this wiki because it provides some intriguing insight into the lore of the world for those interested, but should not be taken as canon.

### Location/Summary:
This book can no longer be found on the map, but it was once in a chest in the ruins of [[Xor'Huul]]. It details the process of a Xorhai priest becoming one of [[Koh]]'s ascended, which turns into a debilitating sickness that spreads throughout the city.

> Months of arduous work have finally come to fruition; my magical research has concluded with what I believe to be a ritual that will ascend us to Kohmari. King Xhuthro's birthday is in the coming weeks, and what better a gift than becoming one with the stone? I will perform the ritual on myself, first.

> The ritual is a success! My newly-gained scales reflect the light of the crystals most brilliantly, and I have celebrated this great victory with the other priests. Though, I have noticed a slight cough that has developed not too long after the ritual occurred. Ah, I'm sure it's nothing but a minor side-effect.

> I fear my insolence will be my undoing, for Koh has forsaken me. Within days my cough has turned into a debilitating weakness, and I barely have the strength to leave my bed. The others... they too have started to develop symptoms, not unlike my own. I must tell them the truth. Oh, what have I done? I beg of you Koh, forgiv...
