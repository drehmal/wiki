This book can be found in a chest at the [[Firteid]] docks. Written by a Drehmari in [[Mossfield]], it is addressed to a [[Maelmari]] living in [[Rhaveloth]] who was his uncle before being ascended. The letter asks Amos (known as Gharak Ahgel as a Maelmari) to come home and see his family.

> Hello Uncle Amos,
>
> I’m not sure if you remember me, but I’m your Drehmari nephew, Silahs. Finding you wasn’t easy- I had to bribe one of the crew bringing freight between Firteid and the Crimson Oasis to do some digging.
> I really hope you’re doing well over there. Your husband, Davahn, is very worried about you. He didn’t want me to send this message, but I refuse to believe that Maelmari only harbor evil in their hearts.
>
> You probably are are thinking a lot about how you can serve the Burnt Lord. Believe me, I understand. But it should be possible to serve Him in some way back home in Mossfield. Even if you need to go and join some faraway war sometimes, I’m sure that we wouldn’t mind, as long as your family can see you. I haven’t forgotten about your promise to take me and my sister to Prominence Point. Please come back to us soon.
