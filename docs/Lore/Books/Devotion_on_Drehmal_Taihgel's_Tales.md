## Transcription
> The Land-Fall Drake's hard work goes largely unappreciated by the many short-sighted mortals who only credit Drehmal for the ground beneath their feet. While they also worshipped Nahyn and Koh, one group of Taihgel-loving Drehmari carved towns into the cliffsides of the majestic Grand Pike Canyon. Though most of their descendants do not continue the practice, a few beautiful old shrines are preserved. To make sure you see some when visiting, keep an eye on the south-facing cliffs where they meet the canyon floor.
