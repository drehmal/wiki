# The Primal Tree

--8<-- "under_construction.md"

The **Primal Tree** was an extremely powerful organism at the very beginning of the history of Drehmal. It is stated that reality itself formed around the Primal Tree, and that many of the gods of Drehmal—the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/)—were created by the Tree.

The Primal Tree only existed during the First Avihm, during which time it created the first Aspects, who in turn were given dominion over certain aspects of reality.

Very little is known about the Tree itself, although it appears to have been sentient to some degree and extremely powerful. During the [[Felling|Battle of Karesh]] at the end of Av1, the Tree was destroyed at its roots, in an event known as The Felling. As the Tree died, it imparted the last of its energy into the three Deities: [[Maelihs]], [[Virtuo]], and [[Drehmal]], ascending them all to godhood with power greater than any of the individual Aspects. The Felling marked the end of the First Avihm.
