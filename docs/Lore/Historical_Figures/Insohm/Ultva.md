# Ultva Utofal

> - **Lifespan:** ??? - c. Av3 847
> - **Position:** Master of [[Insohm]] (c. Av3 500 - Av3 847)

**Ultva Utofal** (pronounced "oolt-vah oo-toe-fall") was the co-founder of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] and one of its first two Masters, along with [[Hovadchear|Hovadchear Myrik]].

Ultva was the more industrious of the two Insohmic founders, pushing the limits on the Order's technology, taking a particular interest in replicating and studying [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] technology. His ultimate fate is unclear, but he had died or disappeared by at least Av3 847.

## Master of Insohm

As Co-Master of Insohm, Ultva was an incredibly intelligent man, best known for his relentless obsession with uncovering the fallen Empire of Avsohm's secrets and using them to strengthen the Order. 

His known endeavors include the following:

- Organized efforts to break open the veilstone seal over [[Mt. Yavhlix]], with no success despite decades of trying. <br>
- A push to force the people of [[Rhaverik]] mine dangerously large amounts of rock beneath their town in pursuit of small amounts of [[rehntite]]. The rehntite turned out to be mostly impure and in small quantities, and the extensive mining eventually caused a cave-in, killing much of the workforce and leading the town to become abandoned. <br>
- (Likely) supporting the research at the [[Coven of Potentia]]. <br>
- Unsuccessfully attempting to replicate Avsohmic materials recovered from [[Sal'Mevir]] at the [[Insohmic Research Center]] in the [[North Heartwood]].

Following the last item, Ultva stormed away, reportedly never to be seen again.

## Final Sightings

At the end of his life, Ultva ventured to an [[Avsohmic Vault]] on an island west of [[Casai]], and sealed himself inside. Based on a report in [[Journal of Councilman Kihfs'Mihnar]], Ultva read something that caused him to go insane while in the vault, and was the only person inside for days, with only the sounds of "arcane noise" and mumbling audible to those outside. This appears to have happened just before or around the same time that [[Castle Hovadchear]] disappeared, in Av3 847. 

Ultva's fate is not clear—he may have died inside the vault, been disappeared from the vault by a higher power, or returned to Castle Hovadchear and disappeared with it. Regardless, there are no known sightings of Ultva following the castle's disappearance.

## In-Game

In the [[Avsohmic Vault]], players can find the [[Ultva's Bowblade]] legendary item, formerly Ultva's signature weapon. The [[Artifacts#Bloodied Nullblade|Bloodied Nullblade]] artifact in this vault is also likely related to the former Master of Insohm, possibly being a blade that he used on himself or someone else in the vault.
