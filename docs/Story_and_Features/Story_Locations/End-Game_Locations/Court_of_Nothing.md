The **Court of Nothing** is one of the final end-game locations in the main story of Drehmal, accessed from the [[Stasis Facility]] after the sequence at the [[Resonant Halls]].

    These coordinates will take the player to the mural room, which contains a portal to the Court ONLY THROUGH THE PROPER STORY SEQUENCE. Do NOT attempt to teleport to these coordinates before reaching them naturally, or you will risk sequence-breaking the map.

## Story
After finishing the sequence at the [[Resonant Halls]] and being invited to the Court, the player must return to the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] one final time, where they will be given the [[Trinkets#Rhythmic Thing|last trinket]]: the ![[rhythmic_thing.gif]]{ width="32" } Rhythmic Thing. This item tells the player to "Return to the place you had risen, lest you wish not to be chosen."

As the player returns to [[Overworld|Drehmal]], the voice returns to speak to them once more. It tells them of [[Tethlaen]], and how they were determined to save the realm despite the voice's warnings, and how few people truly cared for him despite this act of heroism. The voice then disappears.

When the player reaches the [[Stasis Facility]] once again and begins the descent from the surface, the voice returns, and begins to unveil some of their secrets to the player. It tells the player that it is "the titanic power at the center of creation," poetically describing its duties and raw power as the player makes their way back to the room in which they awoke. At this point, the figure creates a dark hole in the far wall of this room, leading to a different room.

As the player enters this chamber, the voice reveals its true name, giving the player a brief nausea effect as their mind struggles to comprehend it: the [[yellow.md|Mythoclast]].

> The portrait of the Mythoclast.

This room contains a mural of the Mythoclast. He (1) claims it does not directly reflect his true physical form, which is incredibly difficult to capture. At this point, he grants the player a tangible reward for the journey they have undergone: a copy of the [[Mythbreaker]], named "The Mythbreaker." This version of the spear is as powerful as the charged variant at baseline, and can be used indefinitely without fear of it breaking. The Mythoclast then opens a portal to his Court, beckoning the player forth, but warning that this is a point of no return, as time runs differently there.

1. From this point on in story articles, The Mythoclast is referred to using he/him pronouns, as is canon. Prior use of "it" or "they" to describe Mytho and his voice are purely for spoiler protection at that point in the story.

> The main room of the Court of Nothing.

Once the player is ready, they may proceed through the portal, where they are teleported to the Court of Nothing. Proceeding upwards along a long walkway, the player eventually ends up in the Court itself, in a large room with a yellow throne and an eye positioned directly above it. In this room, the player is thrust into a boss battle against [[UH|Ultva, Genocide of One and Hovadchear, Master of the Order]], the two founders of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. These two, who both mysteriously vanished during the Third Avihm, have been kept alive by the Mythoclast.

When the player defeats these two, the Mythoclast laments their ultimate fate, and states that their souls will now be reborn. He then calls the player forward through one more portal, ending the section of the story by taking the player to the [[Maddened Path]].

## Gameplay
The player remains in Survival Mode throughout the portion of this sequence at the Stasis Facility, but is placed into Adventure Mode upon entering the Court. 

The only enemies present at the Court are Ultva and Hovadchear. In this battle, Ultva uses his signature [[Ultva's Bowblade|Bowblade]] to fire arrows at the player, while Hovadchear uses his [[Hovadchear's Greathammer|Greathammer]] as a slower but heavier-hitting enemy. Only Ultva can be damaged initially, with any attacks from the player on Hovadchear being deflected by a magical aura. When the player manages to defeat Ultva, the message "Hovadchear enters a primal rage..." plays in chat, and Hovadchear becomes slightly faster but vulnerable to damage.

On death, both Ultva and Hovadchear drop a single bone, a piece of coal, and their respective helmets.

## Lore
Mytho's dialogue and other external sources suggest that the Court is where all souls in the universe are brought for judgment after death, and where the Mythoclast determines their future via reincarnation. This ultimate fate of souls is known to very few (if any in the present day) on Drehmal.

At the very top of the room is a massive orb, strongly resembling an eye. It is not clear if this is meant to be the literal eye of The Mythoclast or another entity, or if it is simply a decoration or symbolic representation of the judgment enacted at this location. The Court of Nothing appears to be contained within the Heart of the Void, the radiant core of the universe and the point into which everything ultimately collapses and from which all is recreated.

## Extras
The dialogue transcript from this section can be found [[End-Game_Dialogue.md#Terminus (Post-Halls)|here]]. This article contains sections 6-8 (**Terminus (Post-Halls)** through **Court of Nothing**).

***

In [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1]], the Court was accessed from a portal on top of a mountain on the [[Island of Dawn]], not at the Stasis Facility. The build for the portal can still be found deep inside that mountain.
