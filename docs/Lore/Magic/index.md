# Magic in Drehmal

The world of Drehmal has been home to many different kinds of magic throughout its history, discussed in this section.

Almost all magic in this universe falls into two very broad categories: Divine Magic and Runic Magic.

## Divine Magic

Divine Magic is, broadly, the type of magic that is naturally harnessed by the [gods of the realm](/Lore/Higher_Beings/), heavily associated with [[Primal Energy]]. This can take almost any form depending on its wielder, and its use by mortals is the overarching goal of all [[alchemy]].

## Runic Magic

All magic used by mortals is based on a system of runes (not particularly fleshed out in-game), first gifted to [[Drehmari]] in Av1 by [[Khive]], the Aspect of Magic. These allow mortals to harness magic for small-scale, specific purposes, but it has grown to be arguably just as diverse as the gods' magic across its many forms, although considerably weaker.
