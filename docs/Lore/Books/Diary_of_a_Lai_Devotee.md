### Transcription:
> I lead a simple, but fulfilling life. I tend the fire, I eat, and I sleep. Once every moon a traveller passes by, drawn to my beacon. I feed them well and let them drink, then send them on their way. My only wish is that the mystical stone which powers my fire will let it burn forevermore.
