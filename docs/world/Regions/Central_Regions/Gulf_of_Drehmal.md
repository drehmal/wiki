## Geography

The Gulf of Drehmal is a coastal region that is mostly made up of rugged hills, forest, and swamp. On the eastern side of the region the coast is a low beach bordering large cliffs. There are two rivers in the region, one small river that drains from near the center of the region into a delta and then the main gulf, and the [[Resting river]], much larger one that flows from much further inland in [[Purity Peaks]] and [[Akhlo'Rohma]].

Regions bordering the Gulf of Drehmal include:

- [[Merijool]]
- [[Capital Valley]]
- [[Purity Peaks]]
- [[Akhlo'Rohma]]
