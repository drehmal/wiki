This book can be found on a lectern atop the [[Burnt Palace]]. Written by [[Maelihs]] after he went to Western [[Xivrhynt]], it hints at a secret about the origins of himself and [[Virtuo]] told to him by [[Khive]], implying that two groups called the Maelruhn and Viruhn were driving forces in making these two deities into who they are.
