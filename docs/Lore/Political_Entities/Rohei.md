**Rohei**, called the **Free Lands of Rohei** or the **Roheian Empire** at different points in its history, was a group of [[Tehrmari#Ro'Tehrmari|Ro'Tehrmari]] living in [[Nahyn's Domain]] after being exiled from [[Naharja]] by the La'Tehrmari.

Effectively no solid dates are known for Roheian history, but an approximate outline of its rise and fall is present in the map.

## Origins

!!! note "See [[The Origins of Rohei]]."

Rohei was initially formed by a fusion of two rival gangs from [[Naharja]], led by a pair of childhood friends. Meri Nelahvan and Asa Clasahle, the two leaders, were initially friends as children, but reportedly grew apart due to differences in music taste, eventually coming to lead their own gangs within the city. Tensions between the sides escalated to gang warfare in the streets, leading to the exile of both groups by the Scalebound. Together, these Ro'Tehrmari leaders settled their differences and unified the two gangs under the Free Lands of Rohei.

## Known History

!!! note "See [[A History of the Roheian Empire]]."

Over time, Rohei grew in influence, attracting Tehrmari from all over the moon who wished for an escape from the strict clergy in La'Tehrmari cities. Unfortunately, the original settlers of Rohei began to form their own bureaucracy, and formed a state cult which forbade the worship of the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/), viewing them as imposters. This stricter religious institution was the grounds for the Free Lands rebranding to the Roheian Empire.

While this policy change was quickly overthrown, the Roheian Empire did not change its name back, and the state cult became the norm despite religious freedom technically being granted.

Rohei seems to have collapsed at some point in Av3, during a massive crackdown by the [[Tehrmari#Talon|Talon]] on Ro'Tehrmari leaders, possibly [[Sereven]]'s Coup. Rohei's leaders, like many other Ro'Tehrmari leaders, were wiped out by the Talon, and the survivors were forced into hiding while the enforcers purged the moon. This purge was ended by [[Yriel]]'s creation and slaughter of the Talon in return, creating an unsteady peace between the La'Tehrmari and Ro'Tehrmari. Regardless, Rohei fell, and no longer appears to be a significant political force today, if it even exists.

## Extent

Rohei appears to have occupied some territory in [[Nahyn's Domain]], potentially including [[Fort Aelon]], as well as parts of southern [[Moen's Domain]]. At its height, it may have also expanded south to [[Palaesida's Domain]] and/or [[Dahr's Domain]].
