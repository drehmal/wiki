This book can be found in a chest in [[Semehol]]. It is the last of four books in the "Tharhan: A Land of Conquest" series, and focuses on the Tharhan experience under [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] rule, up through the [[Fall of Avsohm|fall of the empire]].

## Transcription
> Therefore, it was largely through a series of surrenders and alliances that Avsohm subdued the West. Caer Adacia was retained as a regional locus of command, but never again would an Empress hold absolute authority over the plains.
>
> Life under Avsohmic rule brought many changes for the Tharhan Drehmari. The former provinces of Erxsival and Salahnar were ironically reunited with the long-lost Tharhan lands of Anyr'Nogur under the rule of House Anyr at Sal'Anyr (formerly the Casain metropolis of Azen'nath). Meanwhile, Loraga was subsumed into Nimahj, where House Silar ruled Nimahj Citadel. Finally, Dehar and the Veldt were ruled by House Vera at Caer Adacia.

> The story of Avsohm in its entirety is one for another volume, but for the Tharhanese, Avsohmic rule usually meant a life of hard labor in the river valleys. In exchange for producing much of the food for the Empire, however, the people did achieve a very high standard of living, with new benchmarks for sanitation, health care, technology, and personal mobility set every year. As we all know, though none predicted at the time, Avsohm never survived its third ruler. With no warning and in barely a day, the entire ruling structure of Avsohm disappeared. Along with massive loss of life came a mass upheaval of social order and rejection of any Avsohmic technology or paraphernalia. Taking advantage of the chaos, Maelihs quickly seized his opportunity. Soon, in what became known as the Dune Wars, the Burnt Lord massacred the Drehmari of the West all the way to the wall of Maehrn'Vhos. Even Caer Adacia was powerless to stop it.
>
> Since Mael's takeover, only Fort Nimahj has continued to stand as a bulwark for Drehmari in the cruel Tharxax Plains. That condition is one that the Insohmic Coalition seeks to remedy. With Merijool and Casai now voting members of the Grand Council, the time is ripe for a Tharhan resurgence. It is this historian's hope that this account will help the Drehmari who come to settle in a new Tharhan to begin rekindling the embers of a great Western society. There have been many successes for the people of the plains, and just as many failures. But whether a new Drehmari ruler comes to sit at Caer Adacia or Tharxax City, it would be wise for them to heed the voices of the past.
