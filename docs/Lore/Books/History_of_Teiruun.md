## Transcription
> Our glorious monastery, Teiruun, was founded many centuries ago in the Second Avihm. Shortly after the end of the Deity War, a Virmari led a small group of Drehmari to this very mountain, where they set up camp. Over the next hundred years, this group and their descendants built what you see today. Satisfied with her work, the Virmari leading the monks sailed North on a nomadic journey, and was never seen again. When she left, she handed her position to the First Abbot, a Drehmari by the name of Klvena. Since then, the First Abbot of Teiruun has always been a Drehmari, unlike other old Parishes, where Virmari usually led.

> As the Monastery developed, it began to be known as a place of meditation and wellness. Travellers visit from all across Drehmal in order to bath in our springs, renowned for their healing properties. As it matured, the monkhood took up the practice of medicine, to better treat the afflicted. Some of our number also took up art; inspired by the illustrious painters of Spearhead and the bonsaists of the Black Jungle. Using the knowledge granted to us by the study of the body, many monks took up the practice of self-mummification; a fatal art that requires immense meditative fortitude. Few of our number have ever attempted it, and fewer have completed it; those who have are honored by shrines dotted around the monastery.
