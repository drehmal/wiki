## Transcription
> Turvol, Marehl's son, left the village this morning, claiming that he would finally solve the mystery of the great bridge. This always happens every couple years. A young man is born, gains an adventurous spirit, and sets his eyes on that kehf'ml bridge. I don't understand the interest!
>
> It's just a stupid bridge! All this nonsense about 'pylons' and 'ruined pipes' doesn't matter. Can't we all accept that it's just a bridge? Nothing more?
>
> Turvol will be back tomorrow morning when he realizes how fruitless it is.
