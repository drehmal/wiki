## Transcription
> *You feel an arcane presence...*
>
> \*Player returns to Core Facility from Numencore, with charged Mythbreaker*
> 
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Wretched destroyer!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] The remnant of Avsohm fulfilling their fool’s errand... how despicable!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Hundreds of years have passed, and you still seek dominion of this realm?!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] You are no Anyr, remnant!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] In the sacred name of thy Tree, you face the Elder Will!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] The remnant’s actions echo throughout the realm…
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] We have been watching you closely, destroyer.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Thou'rt an utter disappointment.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Anyr hungered for power, and it brought his empire’s downfall.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] For what dost thou seek to complete his work?
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] What do you have to gain?!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Destroyer!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Ruiner!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Thief!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Dost thou hear his whispers?
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Do not heed them, for he is false!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] He seeks only ruination!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Hast thou become his disciple?
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] If so, I have failed.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Mine only redemption is through your obliteration.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] The vessel you carry is false, derived from a power you cannot fathom.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] The very same power slaughtered your people.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Perhaps they could have been saved, had I banished the boors from our home when I had the chance.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Perhaps I could have saved you as well.
>
> \*Dialogue pauses here during the run.*
>
> \*Player reaches Mt. Yavhlix door*
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] So be it, destroyer.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] If thou seeketh destruction, it surely lies within!
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] This mountain will swallow you whole.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Go on, see for yourself.
>
> \*Player opens Mt. Yavhlix door*
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Do not hark to the whispers.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Do not lend an ear to him.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] Abandon your task, remnant.
>
> [Mystic Elder Khive] It will only lead to ruin.
>
> *The arcane presence vanishes.*

### Bonus

If the player attempts to use a [[Trinkets#Khivian Scroll of Sanctuary|Khivian Scroll of Sanctuary]] during the run, the scroll will be ineffective, and Khive will mock the player:

> [Mystic Elder Khive] Thy thinketh to use my own works against me? Pathetic. The master's tools cannot dismantle the master's house.
