**Ihted** is a ruined city in eastern [[Capital Valley]], home to the [[Devotion]] site for [[Khive|Mystic Elder Khive]]. It lies on the eastern bank of the Noroehl River, the river which runs south from the [[Primal Caverns]].

The ruins are centered around a ruined, nameless ziggurat, which is the site of Khive's devotion altar.

## Layout

The ziggurat is the town's main feature, with signs around it claiming that this is an active dig site. Several small tents are set up around the ziggurat, inhabited by [[Drehmari]] archeologists attempting to re-discover ancient runes or treasure. The ruins of the town are primarily made of stone brick and other simple materials, west of the ziggurat.

Much of the content in Ihted is located underground, with multiple buildings containing subtle cues for players to dig down and discover hidden rooms and structures. The most prominent of these is a small ruined building just to the southwest of the ziggurat, with a chiseled stone brick visible in the floor. Below this block is a series of short interconnected hallways, resembling a dungeon or jail cells. 

The [[Artifacts#Mystic Vow|Mystic Vow]] artifact is found here.

## Khive Devotion Guide

The devotion altar itself is located at the top of the ziggurat, surrounded by low-level offerings: primal pearls, books, and chiseled blocks of all types. The nearby hint book, [[Mercenary's Resignation]], suggests that the pertinent information would be contained in brewing stands, and that they have found nothing above ground.

Several brewing stands in the underground portion of Ihted do, however, contain higher-level offerings for Khive's devotion.

Like all other devotion sites, a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] can be found in Ihted. This relic vessel is found in the main underground area, behind iron bars in a 1-block wide room at **(1069, 55, 1115)**.

## Lore

This place, discovered by [[Avsohm]] under [[Ifeihl|Emperor Ifeihl]]'s reign, was once a hub of runic magic and Khive worship. It is believed to have originated from the very early Second Avihm, and is named after a different city, which was once a metropolis centered around Khive's teachings. That city existed only in the First Avihm, before the [[Felling]], and is considered lost to time.

Avsohm's rediscovery of the ruins led to an excavation effort, attempting to learn more about the runic magic used here.

Its story is mostly contained in the book [[Annoyed Archeologist's Thoughts]].
