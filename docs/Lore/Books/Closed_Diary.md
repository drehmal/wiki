### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in [[Virtuo]]'s chamber in [[Ytaj]]. Written by the Goddess herself, it contains her thoughts and future direction following the meeting with the Aspects that she initiated following the events of her previous diary, [[Powerless]]. Within, she resolves to travel to [[Eastern Xivrhynt]], as she believes she could do more good in that scarred land, and takes her Parish with her, partially to remove [[Vahid]] from the continent.

### Transcription:
> Of course, even Ytaj is horribly marred by chaos, conflict, and corruption. None of the Aspects are physically present, of course, terrified as they are of their own deaths at the teeth and claws of siblings. And the Tehrmari population was notably lower from my last visit near the end of the so-called “Deity War”. Apparently, more had lived within the palace until recently, when the Aspects’ servant cut down dozens in what sounded like an effort to “restructure” the law enforcement body.
>
> Initially, the meeting I did have with the projected consciousnesses of the Aspects was deeply dissatisfying. I began by baring my heart, talking about my recent rage. All of the Prismatic Council, however, agreed that selfishness, warfare and xenophobia were a part of Drehmari that I could not take away. Taihgel urged me to return to my role at the Kiln to provide advice, healing, and purification to the masses. Loe and Lai both advised me to join Vahid’s war effort, while the Elder Aspects seemed very concerned about it. Dahr offered to allow me to stay at Ytaj for a while. Rihelma and Khive did not speak much beyond pleasantries.
>
> The one thing that finally brought me some hope was an offhand comment made by Mari about the suffering peoples of the edge of the world still clinging to the land where I was born. The faces from that time flashed through my head, and as I thought about its toxic vistas and mutated foliage, I realized how much of a positive difference I could make over there. By the time that Vayniklah offered to “fix” my eye, I turned her down on instinct. This injury will serve as an excellent reminder to never again grow complacent.
>
> It is time now to do the work that Drehmal and the Tree once did before me. I will begin with the eastern edge before moving on to the west and the central continent upon which I have spent too many years. Though very impatient, it is far closer than its distant outer siblings.
>
> After I have a bath and I relax in my lovely garden for a spell, I have only one last task: Reach out to Vahid and the other Grand Pontiffs and tell them where the Parish must go. Though I am hesitant to bring too many outsiders to Xivrhynt, I am liable to forget something if I try to do everything myself.
>
> Vahid is especially a concern. I hate his exposed eye socket, his ceaseless ambition, and how he looks at me with fervent zeal and lust in equal measure. But he is not all bad, and Drehmal will be safer with him at my side than at the helm of a second Order of Insohm.
>
> Enough writing and more bathing. I hope beyond hope that the Drehmari will not hate me for my decision today. It is time to sign off this diary for the first and last time. My place is with the mortals, not here.
