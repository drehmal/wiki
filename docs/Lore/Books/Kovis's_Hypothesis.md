This book can be found in a shulker box in the [[Exodus Vault]]. It contains some facts and some speculation on how the Resonant Eye functions from [[Misc Avsohm#Kovis|Kovis]], a [[Blue Exodus]] staffer.

## Transcription
> Here at Blue Exodus, our technology is second to none.
>
> Well, perhaps second to the main Avsohmic Department of Science. Our funding might eclipse theirs now, but they have a massive head start. Before the DoS invented its inscription techniques and applied them to rehntite, a sword was probably the best infantry weapon around. We owe them a lot, and therefore take a keen interest in their projects.
>
> Without a doubt, their greatest achievement in recent times is the creation of the Resonant Eye. While they haven't divulged the exact processes by which it works, we do know a few things.
>
> For one, the heart of the Eye is a one-of-a-kind stellarator primal catalyst. It projects a microscopic "observer particle", which is somehow perfectly linked to a receiver.
>
> Waves or vibrations near the observer are exactly transmitted to the receiver, and are projected in holographic form in a large, two-story "retina chamber". Though this process is incredibly energy-intensive, that is no longer a concern.
>
> Aside from the Eye's obvious surveillance utility, the technology could have military applications. If sufficient energy was beamed into an observer particle, it perhaps could transmit a small, lethal beam of Primal Energy across the continent to terminate a living target.
>
> When we are through with the Mythbreaker and Apotheosis Project, we shall look into collaborating with the DoS to develop this new weapon. This has the potential to massively improve society by way of dissuading criminal acts. May the Emperor rule forever! Hail to Avsohm.
