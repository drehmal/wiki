**Xivrhynt** (also referred to informally as "Xiv") is the collective name for the land on the [[disc]] outside of the main continent of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Xivrhynt can be further divided into two continents: **Western Xivrhynt** at the far western edge of the disc, and **Eastern Xivrhynt** at the far eastern edge.

These two continents are remnants of the world from the First Avihm, mentioned very sparingly and believed to be almost entirely uninhabitable for different reasons.

## History

![[av1map.png]]
> A map depicting the three continents of the First Avihm, with the original western continent on the left, Primzahl in the center, and the original eastern continent on the right.

In the First Avihm, the land on the disc was partitioned into three continents: the central land of [[Lore Locations#Primzahl|Primzahl]] and two outer continents, to the far west and east respectively. The western continent was likely inhabited by the [[Maelruhn]], with the [[Viruhn]] living on the eastern continent.

The [[Felling]] of the [[Primal Tree]] almost totally destroyed the land of the disc, with [[Drehmal]] born at the dawn of Av2 to rebuild the world. The other two deities are believed to have come from the two outer continents, with [[Maelihs]] being born in the west and [[Virtuo]] originating from the east. 

In their reformation efforts, Drehmal appears to have pulled parts of the land from the original western and eastern continents to be added to the modern-day continent of Drehmal, leaving behind the most broken parts as Xivrhynt.

It is suggested that there were a few survivors of the Felling in Eastern Xiv, at the very least. In late Av2, during the reign of [[Anyr]], a manned [[Red Dawn]] expedition (on behalf of [[Avsohm]]) was sent to the eastern continent, the first known contact between the mainland and Xivrhynt in over 1800 years. This trip is documented in the [[Expedition Team Log]]. The mission discovered the ruins of what they believed to be the Bright Capital, the fabled capital of the [[Viruhn]], but the majority of the team was wiped out by "inverse black orbs", highly reminiscent of [[Those Beyond|those]] that would later have a role in [[Fall of Avsohm|wiping out the empire]].

Practically nothing is known about post-Felling West Xiv, with only one clear event tied to it. In approximately Av3 900, [[Maelihs]] made a trip to the continent, seeking to find answers about his creation. He learned something here, and in Av3 902, he and Virtuo were given a formal explanation of their origins by [[Khive]]. Whatever Khive told the two disgusted Mael, causing him to blame the Maelruhn and Viruhn for "setting in motion this sick world."

Shortly thereafter, a distraught [[Virtuo]] was reminded by [[Mari]] of the peoples allegedly still living in Eastern Xivrhynt. Virtuo, believing to have found a new purpose, set off to fix the place of her birth, taking her entire Grand Parish with her and leaving behind the trauma of the mainland. This event marked the end of the Third Avihm.

## Appearance and References

Both Xivrhynt continents are believed to be the scraps of post-Felling world, the least salvageable parts of the original First Avihm world. As such, each half of Xivrhynt is uniquely twisted and highly inhospitable.

Western Xivrhynt is described by a [[Mael Dialogue|late-game dialogue interaction]] as being "wreathed in chromatic fury". This term does, curiously, appear in a few other places in the map. "Chromatic" is a term used to describe the Sacred Flame of [[Lai|Brightwyrm Lai]], Aspect of Warmth, as seen in his sacred places throughout west [[Merijool]]. Specifically, the term "chromatic fury" appears in the book [[Forbidden Bones]]: "Did you know that if an arcanist overexerts themselves, they are consumed by a blaze of chromatic fury?" This points towards the possibility that some kind of extremely intense magical ritual was performed in what is now Western Xivrhynt.

Eastern Xivrhynt, said to be a months-long trip from the main continent by sea, is depicted in more detail in [[Expedition Team Log]]. This book writes that the landscape is warped and twisted, often shrouded in a thick black fog. The crew found the ruins of what they believed to be the Bright Capital partially submerged underwater, with something in the center of the ruins emanating a black light. 11 of the 15 crew members were then wiped out by [[Those Beyond]], prompting the team to return to Drehmal and plan for an expedition to the west instead. This all suggests a strong connection between East Xiv and the [[Nothing]], with a strong possibility that another tear in the fabric of reality, similar to the Spiral Anomaly at [[Mt. Yavhlix]], exists on this continent. This journey to Western Xivrhynt would not come to pass before the end of Avsohm. 

The [[Artifacts#Leliouria|Leliouria]] artifact likely originates from Red Dawn's Eastern Xivrhynt expedition.

In one of the final sequences in the game, a character describes the endless space beyond the [[Veil]] as "the primordial nothing and pockets of chromatic fury". This seems to very closely parallel the states of the two halves of Xivrhynt.

## Extras

### Other Depictions

At a point in development, an in-game Xivrhynt was planned, but this did not ever make it into the map. As such, depicting Xivrhynt is a popular pastime for passionate Drehmal community members.

??? warning "Post-75% Spoiler"
    From space, Western and Eastern Xivrhynt can be seen on the disc. Western Xivrhynt appears black and burnt, while the east is fractured into pieces with the ocean dividing its multiple continents.

### Trivia

In previous versions of the map, the structure on the southern [[Island of Dawn]] resembling a portal from the [Botania](https://botaniamod.net/index.html) mod was referred to by a nearby book as a failed portal to Xivrhynt. This book has since been removed.
