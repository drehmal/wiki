>
> Red Dawn has completed their God Machine. The elusive alchemical Great Work, at Avsohm’s very fingertips. Lord Anyr is eager to use it. He will ascend to be as one with the Aspects, necessary for the inevitable battle with Mystic Elder Khive. Charging Mythbreaker will certainly anger the Great Arcane Aspect, most powerful of all the Elders. He will attempt to stop Anyr, stunt our growth. Now we just wait for the right time. If used prematurely, the God Machine’s power draw will blow the entire energy network.
