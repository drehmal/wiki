The **Resonant Halls** are an end-game story location, accessed after [[Azimuth Labs]]. The Halls are located in the deepest recesses of [[Mt. Yavhlix]], only accessible through a passageway in the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] that is initially sealed by veilstone. This seal is only removed once the player has reached its dedicated end-game sequence. If the player approaches the entrance to the halls before this sequence, they are given the message, "The emptiness in your soul feels strongest here."

The Resonant Halls contain some of the final secrets regarding [[Avsohm|Avsohm's]] truest ambitions, including arguably their greatest piece of technology and the actions that ultimately led to their downfall.

    The first set of coordinates can be accessed at any point after breaking the seal on Mt. Yavhlix, but the second location is intended only to be accessed as part of its dedicated story sequence. Do NOT attempt to teleport to these coordinates prematurely, or you will risk sequence-breaking the map.    

## Story
Once the player makes it back to the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]] from Azimuth Labs, they are given another item by the yellow-possessed [[avSYS]]. 

[[Trinkets#Resonant Thing|This trinket]], the ![[resonant_thing.gif]]{ width="32" } *Resonant Thing*, tells the player: "Deep within the mountain of holes, lies a place that will empty your soul."

Returning to Mt. Yavhlix, the mysterious voice returns to give the player a cryptic message: a direct quotation of the [[Stranded Thesis]]. It disappears until the player reaches the seal, returning only to break it and beckon the player forward into the halls.

The Resonant Halls are a winding, maze-like area, intended to be difficult to navigate in order to protect the room at its core. Over the course of the journey, a few books provide insight into Avsohm's actions at this facility.

It is revealed through transcriptions of dives into the [[Nothing]] by a device called the Resonant Eye that [[Tethlaen]], the [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) that the player slew on an [[Nothing Island|island in the Nothing]], had entered for noble reasons, intending to save the realm by holding the tear closed and preventing the dangerous influx of [[Primal Energy|primal energy]] into [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. They developed a strong rapport with [[Orix Cehein]] over the course of at least 27 conversations, and appear to have eventually cooperated with Avsohm's expeditions into the dimension, even becoming friendly towards the empire. After navigating through multiple labyrinthine areas and a dark, water-filled chamber, the player eventually reaches the secret at the core of the facility: the Resonant Eye itself.

![[resonant_eye.png]]
> The room housing the Resonant Eye.

The Resonant Eye was, as writings here attest, possibly Avsohm's greatest creation. A near-perfectly optimized [[Arcanism|runic]] machine, the Eye was capable of projecting images and audio from other locations, including those beyond the tear (the Spiral Anomaly), to the room where it was physically located in Mt. Yavhlix. There are 15 total holotexts in this facility, all found within this very room, and they tell the tale of Avsohm's interactions with the Eye.

On the very first dive, the Eye was only able to make out the shape of wings, presumably those of Tethlaen, before the dive was aborted out of fear. On the second dive, the Avsohmic researchers were able to establish contact with Tethlaen, but could not communicate clearly, and decided to physically enter the tear. This was met with extreme violence from the Aspect, who slaughtered 41 members of the team—all except for the CSO, [[Eleis]], who survived, but was paralyzed from the neck down.

Gradually, Avsohm was able to develop a more positive relationship with Tethlaen, negotiating a deal that allowed them to collect energy from the tear while also helping to restore Tethlaen's body, which had been battered by the Nothing. 

The third dive, however, was markedly more groundbreaking for Avsohm. Attempting to look even further into the Nothing, this dive discovered an untold number, estimated to be in the trillions, of other signals within the Nothing, interpreted as other realms. This discovery—that Drehmal was one of an absurdly high number of realms—was earth-shattering to the researchers. This meant that the stars were not stars, but rather other worlds. One signal in particular was astronomically brighter than the rest, and this signal became the focus of the fourth dive.

Dive #4, focused on the largest signal, was perhaps even more disturbing to the researchers. It revealed two images: what appeared to be the tip of a spear, and a court of some kind. More prominently, though, it also returned an additional message: "I SEE YOU," from an unknown entity. This spear would eventually be replicated as the [[Mythbreaker]], Avsohm's greatest weapon, but the nature of the court was never determined before the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's end]].

While many of the workers at Mt. Yavhlix were horrified by the results of the third and fourth dives, Emperor [[Anyr]]'s reaction was the opposite. He was overjoyed at the news that they were not alone in the universe, seeing the existence of other realms as an opportunity to expand their empire even further. His ambition, it is revealed, was to conquer all of the realms in existence, spreading Avsohm to its absolute fullest extent, and challenging the being who was thought to have created the Mythbreaker by utilizing a copy of the seemingly perfect weapon itself.

The true final log before the empire's fall is a note about the completion of the God Machine at Azimuth Labs, noting that the charging of the Mythbreaker will certainly anger [[Khive]], and that Anyr will need to be granted adequate power to fight back. However, it also notes that the power draw from the God Machine is massive, and firing it prematurely would surely crash the entire Avsohmic power grid.

The final log is written by an unknown staffer at the facility, after an emergency had been declared at Yavhlix. From their writing, we learn that the God Machine was fired early, crashing the power network and causing the Eye to activate on its own. This prompted Orix to hurriedly install the seal on the mountain's door and flee, leaving some personnel trapped inside the facility. It appears that at this point, creatures known as "Those Beyond" began to invade Mt. Yavhlix, consuming everything and bringing about the empire's doom.

As the player takes in these revelations and tries to leave, the voice returns, offering them a portal out to the main Primary Collection Facility. Here, it tells the player that they have one more destination on their journey: the mysterious figure's [[Court of Nothing|court]].

## Gameplay
When the player enters the Resonant Halls from the Primary Collection Facility, they are placed into Adventure Mode, unlike the main portion of Mt. Yavhlix. 

The entirety of the Resonant Halls are built in a labyrinthine style, with three distinct areas that the player must navigate through. In all three areas, the player will have to maneuver around Hole Remnants, invulnerable enemies that appear only as dark heads that slowly drift toward the player and damage them.

The first area is a large room filled with evenly spaced pillars, with a hole down to the void in the center. There is a staircase downwards that the player must find to progress.

    The halls can be navigated as such: <br>

The staircase takes the player to a set of three iron doors, all of which open up to the same area: the second labyrinth. Here, the player will progress by finding another staircase, this time leading upward.

    This labyrinth can be navigated as follows: <br>

At the top of the staircase, the player can access some non-gameplay-important rooms, such as a library, but will eventually come to a large hole, dropping down into a massive, water-filled chamber with large pipes. In this section, the third major area, the player will be given the Blindness effect, and they must navigate between small pockets of air surrounded by glass bubbles, while also avoiding swimming Hole Remnants. This area can be quite difficult to navigate at times, but the exit is found in the third distinct segment of this area, which is much more tightly packed with pipes than the other two.

In version 2.2.1, this area is much more difficult to navigate due to changes made to the Blindness effect made between Minecraft 1.17.1 and 1.20.1. This makes the visibility in this underwater section much lower than intended, and was reverted in version 2.2.2.

    The submerged area can be navigated as such: <br>

Once the player has completed this section, they will find an iron door that opens to the end of the second area, opening a shortcut for themselves or other players. Just up another staircase is the Resonant Eye room, containing all of the location's holotexts, which are required to progress the story.

## Original Writing
There are [15 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-Yav/Resonant_Halls) found in the Resonant Halls, all in the room with the Resonant Eye.

There are also four lore books to be found at this location: three transcriptions of conversations between Orix Cehein and Tethlaen during Resonant Eye dives, and one book describing the Resonant Eye project at large. <br>

## Lore
There is little lore to the Resonant Halls that is not simply a part of the main story.

Multiple pertinent Avsohmic officers are known to have spent time here, predominantly [[Orix Cehein]] as the facility's commanding officer, [[Eleis]] and later [[Thresa Vera]] as Chief Science Officer (CSO), and Researcher Cehva.

## Extras
The dialogue transcript from this section of the story can be found [[End-Game_Dialogue.md#Terminus (Post-Azimuth)|here]]. This article pertains to the 4th and 5th sections: **Terminus (Post-Azimuth)** and **Resonant Halls**.
