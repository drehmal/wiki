## Transcription
> Emperor Anyr really is insane, huh? Never should have cast my vote for him. Total sihf'mihk.
>
> Why did he move here, to all places? Leaving the council to do all his work for him. Just wants to wage war against Maelihs. An unwinnable fight. I don't care how capable the Avsohmic military is, we would be going up against a god.
>
> I enjoyed my life in this city til he came around and turned it into a military stronghold. It was a beautiful, spiritual site, made by the ancient Casain settlers. I greatly enjoyed immersing myself in their exotic culture and even planned on travelling north to Casai one day. But no. Of course not. Now citizens are forbidden from leaving the city for safety.
>
> Kehf'ml toth Anyr.
