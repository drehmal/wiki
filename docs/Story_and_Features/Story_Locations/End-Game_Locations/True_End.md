The **True End**, or the **Final Grave**, is the name for the final location in the main story of Drehmal: Apotheosis. It is accessed directly after the [[Maddened Path]].

## Story
![[true_end_realmbinder.png]]

After defeating the [[Emissary of the Void]], the player is given one final portal to step through, transporting them back to the Stasis Facility. However, the player will notice that the facility is different—grayer and worn-down. As they progress toward the surface just as they did at the beginning of the map, the player will notice sand that has leaked in from outside, and see that much of the facility appears to have decayed.

Climbing to the surface, the player finds the landscape completely covered in a vast expanse of sand, with only the three hills above the [[Primal Caverns]] remaining as a clear landmark. A trail of orderflame lanterns leads into the caverns, and then leads out the back of the central hill.

Emerging from the Primal Caverns, the player reaches the Final Grave, coming across the miles-long skeleton of [[Drehmal]] themself, staring up at the sky. The [end credits](endcredits_transcription.md) play out.

After the credits have ended and the player has sat with the corpse of their creator for a few minutes, the [[yellow.md|Mythoclast]] speaks one more time, telling the player of the ultimate fate of the realm. 

[[Virtuo]] met her demise at the edge of the realm, in [[Eastern Xivrhynt]], succumbing to "decay" (likely meaning the [[Nothing]]).

[[Maelihs]] was never able to overcome his pride and leave [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], and was among the last to die there, watching the world crumble away before he had righted any of his wrongs.

The [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) refused to settle their differences, dying as a family divided.

Drehmal finally awoke and emerged from the caverns, only to find the world they had created was almost entirely dead— except for them. However, at the very same time, the player, experiencing time much differently while by the Heart of the Void, was still alive; the last of their [[Drehmari]], alive and fighting at the end of time. With this knowledge, the creator deity felt peace in their final moments.

The Mythoclast then offers the player closure, asking if they are ready to move on. If the player selects "Yes," then they will be killed and taken away to the end credits room. If they select "Not Yet," then they may wander the dunes for as long as they like, before returning to Drehmal's skeleton and moving on. Either way, the player is the final being alive in the realm of Drehmal, and is ultimately offered closure.

## Gameplay
The player remains in Adventure Mode in the True End. There are no enemies to be found here.

The area which the player can actually explore is restrained to the [[Capital Valley]] region, centered around the Primal Caverns. The True End is an entirely separate dimension from the Drehmal overworld, containing only this area, the future version of [[Sal'Mevir]] accessed during the Temporal Engine puzzle, and the [[Maddened Path]] (located far away from the other two areas).

If the player refuses closure, then they can trigger this dialogue option again by stepping into the yellow pillar of light near the skeleton. Alternatively, using the command `/trigger finality` will select the "Yes" option and transport the player to the end credits room.

## Lore
The True End is foreshadowed by the [[The Facets#Facet III|third Facet]], which directly parallels the end of Drehmal. This has led to significant speculation by the community, attempting to discern the meaning of the so-called "Facets". Some signs indicate that there is a tie between [[Verrhys]], the Aspect of Silence, and the ending of Drehmal, perhaps suggesting ties between Verrhys and the Mythoclast. However, these ties are not concrete, as there is so little information on the Aspect.

> The Verrhys statue in the dunes.

Southeast of the Primal Caverns, a statue of Verrhys, made of identical materials to the one found in the [[Black Jungle]], can be found inside the dunes. However, its pose is different—instead of cowering behind its wings, Verrhys' wings are outstretched, and pieces of it appear to have fallen off. This directly mirrors the final line of Facet III - *"3:6 - And silence will spread its wings."*

> The Dunes Verrhys statue, excavated.

The True End appears to have been inevitable, as suggested by the fact that warping into the future via the Temporal Engine at Sal'Mevir projects the player into this very dimension, in a version of the area covered in the same lifeless desert.
