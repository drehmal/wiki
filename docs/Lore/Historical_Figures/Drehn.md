Drehn Mal'Sohm was the last king of the [[Chosen Kingdom]], and the founder and first emperor of the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]]. He is largely responsible for the empire's early discoveries that fueled its rapid technological growth and territorial expansion. Drehn had democratic and peaceful ideals that differed from many other monarchs, including future Avsohmic leaders. He was known for rarely using brute force to subjugate land, instead often relying on negotiations. He is revered by many as the greatest leader in the realm's history, even in the present day.
