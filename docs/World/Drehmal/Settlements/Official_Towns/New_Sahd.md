# New Sahd

!!! info "This article is about New Sahd, the main town on the island of Sahd. For the overall region/island, see [[Sahd]]."

![[Sahd1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**New Sahd** is the official town of the [[Sahd]] region, located in the bay around the island's geographic center. It is one of few official towns that does not have a direct path leading to it, owing to its location on an isolated island, but it can be accessed directly from the sea, and is easily found once the player has reached the main island.

!!! abstract "Location"
	Approximate Coordinates: `4764, 65, 5702`

New Sahd is on the larger side of Drehmal towns in terms of land area, taking up a significant amount of space but not having a particularly large population. There are 11 distinct buildings in Sahd, but they are spread out further than most other towns, with the space between taken up by wide paths and wheat fields.

New Sahd, like the rest of the structures of Sahd, draws from real-life Japanese architecture styles. Buildings are predominantly built of quartz, with yellow terracotta foundations, spruce log trims, and slanted roofs made out of a mixture of dark oak and acacia wood.

Entering New Sahd for the first time grants the "The Forgotten City" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[new_sahd_map.png]]{ width="400" }
> The in-game map of New Sahd, found near the center of the town's northern half.

New Sahd is divided into two parts by the wide river that runs from southeastern Sahd into the bay. The northern portion contains the majority of the town's buildings, as well as all of its wheat fields, while the southern portion is home to a couple larger buildings and the town's docks. The two halves are connected by a wooden bridge.

### Funerary Boathouse

On the southern side of New Sahd, just east of the docks, the Funerary Boathouse is built directly on the coast. This building is filled with materials for boat-building and embalming, suggesting that the residents of the town practice some kind of [ship burial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_burial). 

A fragment of the [[Frenzy|mythical weapon]] located on Sahd is found on the top floor of this building.

### The Laughing Dragon Inn

The Laughing Dragon Inn, named after [[Mari]], the [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) associated with Sahd and sometimes known as the Laughing Dragon, is one of the town's inns, and the only other building in southern New Sahd. The inn is relatively large, with several rooms marked by different types of plants in item frames outside of their doors. A theater is attached to the western side of the inn.

There are also two [[Runic Catalyst|Runic Catalysts]] to be found in this building, in the staff quarters and theater.

### The Boar's Knife

The Boar's Knife is a building just north of the bridge, home to multiple animal pens and villagers, although there is not a custom trader to be found here.

### Crystal Clear Glass Shop

Crystal Clear Glass Shop is a building in the southeastern portion of northern New Sahd, home to the Glass Merchant, who sells various stained glass colors.

### The Bee's Bunkhouse

The Bee's Bunkhouse is another inn in New Sahd, although it does not have individual rooms—rather, it is home to 7 beds all pressed together against the same wall. The town's [[Cat Maps|Cat Map]] is found in this building.

### Town Square

New Sahd's Town Square is home to three unique merchants, stockpiles of blocks that can be used as resources, and a large gong in its center.

### The Garden Tree Tavern

The Garden Tree Tavern, west of the town square, is home to a kitchen and four rooms on the upper level, with one large double-bed room that holds the other Primal Cache in town.

### The Purple Blade Blacksmith

Located in the northwest of New Sahd, this building is home to the town's Runic Blacksmith.

## Lore

The exact origins of the town of New Sahd are unclear, although from its name, it can be presumed that it is the successor to a previous town that was simply known as "Sahd". Given the island's deeply war-torn history, it is possible that the old capital of Sahd was destroyed and New Sahd was erected in its place. It is also possible that New Sahd is a mixture of the three clans that once inhabited Sahd.

## Extras

### Soundtrack

New Sahd's theme song is "The Forgotten City", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
