# Athrah

![[Athrah1.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Athrah** is the official town of the [[Casai]] region. It can be accessed by following the main path through Casai, from either [[Merijool]] or [[Ebonrun]]. The town sits on the northern shores of Lake Athrah, which feeds the Rai'za, the main river in Casai from the north, and is bordered by mountains to its north and east. <br> <br>

Athrah is a small to average-sized town in Drehmal, consisting mostly of several small buildings. These buildings are predominantly made out of red sandstone, brown concrete, terracotta, and the types of wood found in the area (mostly acacia and oak, with some jungle wood). 

The town is populated entirely by [[Drehmari]], including an [[Adventuring Merchant]] and a [[Runic Blacksmith]], with a high-level blacksmith that sells Runic Amplifiers and an upgraded artisan diamond armor set.

Athrah's central feature is its now-defunct teleportation dock, which once made it an incredibly lucrative center for trade. After the [[Fall of Avsohm]], however, Athrah fell into relative obscurity.

Entering Athrah for the first time grants the "Jewel of Casai" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[athrah_map.png]]{ width="400" }
> The in-game map of Athrah, found near the Adventuring Merchant in the western portion of the town.

Athrah has three distinct areas: the main portion of the city contains a lower level and an upper level on a hill to the north, and a collection of small huts make up the eastern slums.

### Old Athrah Library

The Old Athrah Library is located left (north) of the town map, built into the side of the hill. This library room contains two lore books with information surrounding the history of the region. In the western bookshelf wall, the book [[The Casain Empire]] can be found, which details the founding and early history of the [[Casain Empire]], beginning in Athrah in mid-Av2. [[Origins of the Casain]] can be found on the opposite wall, providing insight into the ethnic groups of the northwestern portion of the continent.

### Old Athrah Teleportation Dock

A large dock surrounded by red sandstone rings is found in Athrah, south of the proper town. This structure, which was once used to ship items throughout the realm, no longer functions, but there are still some stockpiles of resources such as hay bales, melons, slime blocks, and redstone on the pier. A ship at the edge of the dock contains the town's [[Cat Maps|Cat Map]].

### East Bank Slums

On the eastern shore of the lake, separate from the rest of the town proper, a few small, open huts are found. These are the eastern slums of Athrah, where the town's lower class resided.

### The Sandy Bunk

The Sandy Bunk is Athrah's inn, northeast of the town map on the lower level. Its Primal Cache is found just inside the door.

### Athrah Market

A small series of interconnected buildings on the upper level, connected by a single yellow/orange wool canopy, serves as Athrah's marketplace, home to its unique permanent merchants.

### Athrah Graveyard

A small graveyard with gravestones of various stone types is found in the northeast of Athrah, at the base of the mountains surrounding the town. None of the smaller graves contain any items, but there is a small cave to the east of the graveyard with a large, custom skull, which does have a buried chest containing a chthonic rose.

### Other Original Writing

[[Letter from a Faraway Land]] is found on the top floor of a house in Athrah, and a different house closer to the water holds [[The White Vault]], which hints at the location of the [[Avsohmic Vault]].

## Lore

Per "[[The Casain Empire]]", Athrah was founded by Casain leader [[Athrah Zarha]] in Av2 1189, as the first effort to centralize power in Casai, and would eventually become the seat of power from which Zarha and his successors would rule over the [[Casain Empire]]. Athrah grew in influence over time, forcing neighboring Casain tribes to join the empire through small, contained battles and trade embargoes, eventually forming the empire in Av2 1255. Athrah remained the regional center of power through much of the Second Avihm, and appears to have flourished under [[Avsohm]], with its teleportation dock likely being derived from Avsohmic warp technologies. The disappearance of the empire may therefore have been the cause for the teleportation pier's fall into disuse.

Early Av3 also saw a mass exodus from Casai, with Drehmari at the edge of the west fleeing the impending conquest of the [[Empire of Maelihs]]. Coming immediately after the [[Fall of Avsohm]], this mass exodus likely brought about the rapid end of Athrah as a wealthy, important location on the continent.
