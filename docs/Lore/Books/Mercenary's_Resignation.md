> That's it. I've reached my limit with poking around these miserable old ruins! There's no sign of **brewing stands** that were used by "Khive's Chosen." I don't see so much as a **single rune above ground** in this sorry mess! This is the last straw. I'm out of here, and I'm never taking another job at Ancehl Castle from that slimy coot!
