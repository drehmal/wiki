This book can be found in a chest in [[Ihted Academy]]. Written by a [[Blue Exodus]] soldier (possibly [[Orix Cehein]]) recruited to fight in the [[Divine Schism]], it shows that General [[Kahmas Tuhs|Kahmas]] was one of the very few [[Drehmari]] to become truly respected by the inhabitants of [[Lo'Dahr]].

## Transcription
> We're leading the charge to free Sereven from the Palaesidans. Kahmas and I were conscripted through a friend of ours with connection to Brightwyrm Lai up in Faehrcyle, and now Kahmas has been truly cutting his teeth in this combat of deific drakes.
>
> We took a leave of absence from Blue Exodus together in order to participate in the combat here, especially with what the Aspects' representatives were paying. We're essentially making a full three years' worth of Blue Exodus wages in this one campaign at our rank.
>
> Between the Aspect-Born and the Drehmari, we generally receive less respect due to our undevoted nature, but with Kahmas... Kahmas is made to be respected. The man has such an aura, an intelligence that surpasses anyone else that I know. As he and I have proven ourselves on the field of battle, the Tehrmari, Aspects, and Aspect-Born have come to respect him greatly. So, Kahmas was hand-picked by Loe to lead the charge to free Sereven from Ytaj, and Kahmas chose me as his right-hand man. Knowing his leadership and tactics, we'll be in and out of the palace with Sereven and nobody will even know.
