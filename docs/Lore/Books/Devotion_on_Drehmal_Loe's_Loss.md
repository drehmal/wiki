## Transcription
> For most of my life, it was customary for the many Loe worshippers in the hot and temperate West to venture across the continent to the forested western coast of Faehrcyle in order to pay respects at the stunning circular shrine there. Recently, however, a pack of uniquely moronic Drehmari have begun barring their entry. I am certain that the mercurial Glacial Elder must be furious!
