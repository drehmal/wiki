| **Lore**                      | The First Avihm is shrouded in mystery to most living today, as the land itself was largely destroyed by the Felling of the Primal Tree. Yet, even after Drehmal's reforging, traces remain. This ancient greatsword yearns for its long-lost partner. |

## Gameplay
One Thousand Scars is an NBT-modified stone sword, and maintains the durability of a vanilla stone sword.

One Thousand Scars is a greatsword, lending itself towards a slow, high-damage build with its incredibly high attack damage, very low attack speed, and significant movement speed penalty.

The weapon's special ability, Spectra Blade, creates an explosion effect around the target on a successful fully-charged attack, which deals additional damage to the target entity.

## How to Obtain
One Thousand Scars is found beneath [[Castle Scarstone]], a blackstone castle found in the mountains just northeast of the town of [[Gozak]].

Within the castle, a room in the northwest leads down a ladder and to a long spiral staircase. This spiral staircase continues for a very long time until opening up into a massive, dark cavern, at the center of which is a black pyramid. At the top of this pyramid, a trapped chest with the legendary weapon can be found.

## Lore
The exact lore surrounding One Thousand Scars is unclear, but it is known that it is one of the very few remnants of the First Avihm in modern Drehmal. The exact peoples who made it, as well as its supposed "partner," are not known.
