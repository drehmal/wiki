# Drehmal Versions

Dating back to 2017, multiple different versions of Drehmal have been released. This page documents the history of the map, outlining its major updates and the differences between them.

The current official version of Drehmal is v2.2.1: APOTHEOSIS, the 1.20.1 port of v2.2.0, released on July 16, 2024.

Download links can be found on the standalone pages for each version, where applicable. If you would like to play an older version of Drehmal, find the main page for that version here, and ensure that you install the correct dependencies for that version.

## Early Development

The concept of Drehmal began as a worldbuilding project by co-creators Keeko100 and Rift, on a shared Minecraft SMP when the duo were in middle school. Eventually, the pair began work on a custom Minecraft map to reflect this world. A first draft of a Minecraft map did exist before v1, but was never released to the public, and is internally known to the co-creators as the real Drehmal v1. 

This eventually led to the publishing of a second attempt at creating the world, Drehmal v1, in 2017.

## Drehmal v1 (Legacy)

Drehmal v1 (Also known as Drehmal: Legacy) was the first version of Drehmal to exist as a Minecraft map, released on October 27, 2017 for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12.1. This download was primarily a terrain map, with some recognizable biomes and regions from modern Drehmal. However, there was minimal extra content beyond the terrain.

The map is only 8,000 blocks by 8,000 blocks in size, as opposed to the 12,000 by 12,000 block size of Drehmal v2.

Drehmal v2.0 (released with the subtitle: PRIMΩRDIAL) was the first major public update to Drehmal, first announced to PMC in early 2019 and officially released on March 31, 2020 for Minecraft Java Edition 1.15.2. 2.0 gained significant attention from posts by Keeko100 on r/gaming and r/Minecraft, each of which sit at over 100,000 upvotes.

Drehmal v2 is the first instance of modern Drehmal, featuring a massive terrain overhaul which brought the landscape very close to its current appearance and size. It also greatly increased the amount of structures found throughout the world, added the majority of the [towns](/World/Settlements/Official_Towns/), the first custom weapons, and the first iteration of the main story.

Drehmal v2.1 (released with the subtitle: TIMEBREAK) was the first major update to Drehmal v2, released on November 21, 2020 for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.16.5. 2.1 garnered even more attention than 2.0, and saw a massive increase in the size of the Drehmal community. It was the official version of the map for over three years.

2.1 was the first version to feature additional developers beyond co-creators Keeko and Rift, with contributions from HotElbows on custom weapon abilities. It made some tweaks to the main story locations, reworked the fast travel towers, added new [legendaries](/Items/Legendary_Items/), and added abilities to the existing [Mythical Weapons](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/).

## Drehmal v2.2 (Apotheosis)

Drehmal v2.2 (released with the subtitle: APOTHEΩSIS) was the most recent major update to Drehmal v2, fully released on April 5, 2024 for Minecraft: Java Edition 1.17.1. The largest update to the map by far in terms of scope, Drehmal: Apotheosis was worked on by a team of over 15 developers for more than three years, first released in a beta version on August 19, 2023.

- The [[Artifacts|Artifact]] and [[Artisan Items|Artisan]] item classifications <br>
- Abolition of the class boots system from previous versions <br>
- Expansion and re-building of all named ruins <br>
- Over 100 new [lore books](/Lore/Books/) <br>
- Removal of the Nether <br>
- Addition of a full custom [[soundtrack]]

### v2.2.1 (1.20.1)

v2.2.1 is the initial 1.20.1 port of Drehmal v2.2, which also included a few balancing changes, bug fixes, and small pieces of content. 2.2.1 also added most vanilla items added in the 1.18, 1.19, and 1.20 updates to the map, albeit sometimes in minimal roles. 2.2.1 began as a fan-made port by tworoundcats, who was promoted to developer status after completing and presenting the port to the Drehmal dev team in the early summer of 2024.

### v2.2.2 (Current)

v2.2.2 is the current version of the map as of April 15, 2025. It is primarily a polishing patch for the 1.20.1 port, fixing some issues that were not caught in the original porting process while also addressing other long-standing bugs, typos, and more.

## v2.3 (Upcoming)

Drehmal v2.3 is a partially-confirmed update currently in development as of April 2025, announced on the [five-year anniversary of Drehmal v2](https://www.drehmal.net/post/five-years-of-drehmal). Believed to be centered around bringing old points of interest and towns up to the 2.2 standard of quality, rather than adding significant new content, it is the only version of the map in active development at this time.

## v3 (April Fools)

Drehmal v3 was a special joke update released on April 1, 2021. A heavily dated and unserious version of Drehmal 2.1, v3 is stuffed with absurd terrain, community in-jokes, bizarre custom items, and more.
