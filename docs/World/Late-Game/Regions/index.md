> A map outlining the main regions of Lo'Dahr.

This section contains pages on the Aspect Domains of [[Lo'Dahr]], analogous to the [Regions](/World/Regions/) of Drehmal.

There are a total of 15 regions on the divine moon: 14 extremely distinct, fantastical regions owned and shaped by one of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) (which are simply named after their patron Aspect) and the great palace of [[Ytaj]], a colossal temple complex known as the "sacred place of all divinity," which itself serves as the 15th region.

The [[Lunar Wastes]] can be counted as a 16th region, but they are more akin to the absence of a region, and do not contain anything beyond easter eggs.

## Wiki Organization

The pages for Lo'Dahr regions follow a similar format to the [Overworld Region Pages](/World/Regions/), although their smaller size, increased focus on hostile mob spawns, and incredible variation in appearance necessitate a slightly different format.

Regions on Lo'Dahr are all made up of a single biome, meaning there are only 16 total biomes in this dimension. This also means that different textures can be applied to these biomes. Often, the color of water, the horizon, and other commonly placed blocks like grass blocks will change depending on the region they are placed in, adding to the overall theme of that area. This information is denoted in a table at the beginning of each region article.

On Lo'Dahr, several new, custom enemies spawn. These are all some variant of a vanilla mob, usually with an added mechanic and custom texture. These spawns are almost all limited to one biome, and therefore, information on these custom enemies is contained in the "Gameplay" sections of their respective region pages.

Aspect domains are also very small compared to overworld regions, and while they are relatively dense, this means that some domains simply do not have many major points of interest, and they also may not have much known history beyond the history of a single structure.

## Lore

Lo'Dahr was once under the sole ownership of [[Dahr]], the Great Sea Aspect, but at some point, Dahr granted ownership of portions of land to the other Aspects to become their domains, effectively becoming a king in name only. It is unclear how domains were delegated, as certain [Minor Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Minor_Aspects/) have domains while others do not, but all [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/) have a domain, with the Elders' domains being the largest. 

It is believed that each of these regions were hand-crafted by their respective Aspect, as the reconstructed text of the [[Codex Celestus]] implies that each Aspect is only able to use [[Primal Energy]] to perform their specialized tasks. The Aspects pull from Khive's source of Primal Energy within Lo'Dahr, the [[Numencore]], in order to perform their tasks and shape their domains. 

Some of the Aspect Domains are likely not as they were when they were initially made. For instance, Chthonic Skeletons (Wither Skeletons) spawn only in the domains of dead Aspects—[[Noha]], [[Palaesida]], and [[Voynahla]]. [[Noha's Domain]] and [[Palaesida's Domain]] have both undergone drastic changes since their Aspects died in the [[Divine Schism]], with Noha's lush steppe mostly dying out, and Palaesida's eternal storm-fed sea drying up before his bones began a new storm.
