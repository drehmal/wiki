 

Also known as *The Parable of the Lakebed*, as denoted by a sign above the book.

This book can be found on a lectern in [[Drehua Temple]], sacred place of [[Drehmal]]. It is one of four "Parables" in Drehua Temple, which each depict the serpent deity speaking with—and giving advice to—a Drehmari. This parable teaches the Drehmari to take pride in their work, no matter how small it may feel, and to pursue their own passions as well as their work.

## Transcription
> And so it happened that I was strolling on the water's edge after a long week of harvest, as the wind whistled through the peaks of the Ruxihuadel. As I came to the Heap, I again noticed the Great Serpent, straightening out the rocks and restoring life to the battered conifers of some long-lost land. The Serpent was vast; they seemed larger even than when They had last come through the mountain valley where we made our home.
>
> As I approached, the Serpent swung its majestic visage toward me. Dropping to a prayer position, I called out to Them:
>
> "Great Drehmal, I had not anticipated finding you here, but I must humbly request your assistance. Can you spare a moment of your time?"
>
> In a primordial rumble which echoed across the sound, the Serpent laughed.
>
> "Time is immaterial to me, small one. Though I must soon rest, I shall not do so until my work is finished. What is it that you wonder?"
>
> I looked into Their gleaming eye with some trepidation, for They were taller alone than most of the trees in our homeland. Finally, I began to speak:
>
> "Though I have worked in the fields each day this week, until my fingers have become raw and bleeding, even a bountiful harvest strikes me as useless when framed in context of your work! Among the great chaos of the lands in the center of the sea, you find order, and you seem to create the water we drink and the food we labor to grow. What can I possibly do that will contribute in a meaningful way to this world that you change at a moment's notice?"
>
> The Serpent regarded me for a long moment, and then formed Themselves into a coil which could have easily reached around our entire valley. They spoke in the same deep voice, but it carried clear notes of kindness: "Drehmari, your work is no less important! By following your path and working hard to meet the demands of your soul to learn, create, and find happiness, you fulfill your station. Though you are small, and I am big, I am doing no different. After all, it is with the act of repairing what is broken, of bringing order and hope to this place of despair, that brings my soul joy!"
>
> Still in reverent shock that the Serpent was addressing me, I stood still for a moment and considered Their words, before deciding that they did not satisfy me. Daring to speak again, I lifted up my voice:
>
> "If what you say is true, why have you made survival in this place so difficult? Slaughtering animals and spending days in the fields to reap the harvest does not bring me any joy."
>
> The Serpent nodded, and flicked Their gigantic tail, sending ripples throughout the calm water. "It was not my decision to make, but that of my forebears. Like you, I operate within some constraints. But rather than turning to frustration, we must learn to take pleasure in our work. For example, take the walk that you have embarked upon today. Does the air not taste sweeter now that you have spent the week laboring to breathe as you worked in the fields? And is the scenery not more stunning when you have spent so long in the confines of one place? Remember my words: Do the unpleasant things that you must, but take pleasure in the positive impacts of that work. And when the undesirable labor is complete, work toward the creative yearnings of your soul with no less vigor! I believe you will find that a labor of love is no burden at all."
>
> Nodding my head and bowing deeply, I thanked the Serpent for Their wisdom before departing the way I had come. I recalled my wooden flute which I had resolved to put down until the harvest was complete, and suddenly was filled with a great desire to play. Though there were other tasks which would need to be done before the cold arrived, I spent the few hours remaining in the day learning the notes of a new melody.
