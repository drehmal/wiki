**Penumbra** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

A legendary pair of leggings, Penumbra is found in the [[Ebony Veldt]] region, and gives its wearer additional benefits when worn at night, in accordance with the nocturnal assassins who originally wore it and models like it.

| **Lore**                      | The Nightwalkers were the feared enforcers of the Second Tharhan Empresses. After the Six Kingdoms fell to infighting and Casain conquest, all were shocked when black-clad legions rode out from below to seize power. Ironically, resigned Tharhan lords stopped locking their doors at night, because no lock could hope to withstand a single Nightwalker's fury. |
| **Obtain**                    | In [[Caer Adacia]].   |  

## Gameplay
Penumbra is an NBT-modified pair of chainmail leggings, and inherits that item's relatively low durability.

Penumbra is a relatively strong piece of armor at baseline, granting +6 Armor and +2 Armor Toughness for the cost of 2 Max Health, nearly equal to a pair of Celestial (Netherite) Leggings. However, Penumbra gains an advantage when used at night.

The item's special ability, Nightwalker, activates between the in-game hours of 19:00 (7 PM) and 07:00 (7 AM), granting additional stat boosts of +0.015 Movement Speed, +20% Attack Damage, and +10% Attack Speed to its wearer during this window.

## How to Obtain
Penumbra is located in [[Caer Adacia]], a ruined city hidden underground in the eastern [[Ebony Veldt]].

Penumbra can be found at the large dripstone structure in Caer Adacia, which contains one of the small vents that peek up at the surface, in a small pond near the top of the structure.

**Coordinates:** (-1287, 61, 460)

## Lore
Penumbra either was worn by, or was modeled after the armor of, the Nightwalkers—the enforcers of the Second Tharhan Empresses, who ruled from Caer Adacia. Its abilities are a direct reflection of the Nightwalkers' reputation for being stronger at night and acting at night.
