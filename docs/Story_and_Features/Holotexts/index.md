# Holotexts

!!! warning "Holotexts are an inherently spoiler-heavy topic! Be wary of spoilers in this section."

Holotexts are holographic text images that appear in [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facilities throughout the [[Story Progression|main story]] of Drehmal: Apotheosis. 

Typically containing brief messages written about important characters or concepts, they are one of the most important resources for any playthrough of the map. Holotexts also frequently hint at the solution to puzzles in their area, which is not true of lore books.

In-game, holotexts can be recognized by the presence of a lime-colored concrete block on the ground emitting green particles upward, directly in front of two evenly spaced stained glass panes (usually purple). When a player steps onto the concrete block, a sound effect will play and the holotext will be displayed in between the panes.

## Progression

Holotexts are a part of the [[avSYS]] network, and as such, they often cannot be read unless the player's network linkage % is high enough. At the 25%, 50%, and 75% story locations, players will need to find a node to right-click and attempt reconnection, similar to the ones found at the very start, of the game. These will not be able to successfully sync the holotext database for that region unless the requisite network linkage has been achieved, and all holotexts in the area will display the following image until synchronized:

## Holotext Wiki Organization

There are a total of 139 individual holotexts found throughout 14 different in-game locations, each of which has a uniformly formatted page in this section. Due to the spoiler-heavy nature of holotexts, and the fact that they are found exclusively in story-relevant areas, this section of the wiki is divided into tiers based on progression level through the story. Holotexts are named according to the names of their respective files in the resource pack, so they will not necessarily appear alphabetically based on their in-game titles.
