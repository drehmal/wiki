## Transcription
> Ga'ran was working out there all day in the cold brewery. I'm so pleased that she likes my gift so much, but I hope she comes in before too late. A blizzard is rolling in, and no wife of mine is going to freeze to death!
>
> That said, I can't wait to taste what she's been working on. Her talents are the only reason that my dream of running an inn has come true. Why else would anyone come to this snowy wasteland?
>
> I love her so much.
