## Transcription
> The fallen God speaks to me through dreams. He does not speak, but I know his purpose. His cult is destroyed, His influence all but evaporated, and He is angered. Now, terror grips the realm by the neck. The people are choked and cannot breathe. A new age of the Ever-Fear here.
>
> I dream of a grave. It is a dead mountain, littered with holes as if stabbed a thousand times over. It is no volcano, no tower of ice and snow, but a cold dead heap of shattered ambition. It is here where the tide rises and they all come to regret their ignorance. It is here where the Cult shall be reborn. And when our God rises again and climbs the pantheon of Ytaj, toppling its towers and drawing a dagger to His Father's throat, we shall stand alongside Him.
