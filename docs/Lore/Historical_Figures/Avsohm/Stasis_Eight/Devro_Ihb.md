## History

Devro Ihb grew up in the Heartwood town of [[Kazzani]], and rose to prominence in adulthood as a skilled sailor and captain of his own ship. He is known as a pirate, and seems to consider himself as such, but was mostly known for his exploration of the realm, not any kind of plundering or naval combat.

During this time, Ihb wrote a series of memoirs, the "Travels of Captain Ihb" series. His books became incredibly popular as adventure novels, especially with children, and Ihb became a celebrity figure. He wrote about his travels to plunder the pirates of [[Palisades Heath]], re-discovering the land of [[Sahd]], and attempting to find the remnants of Clan Xorha on the [[Island of Dawn]].

Some time after settling down in [[Port Solitude]] following his career as a sailor and writer, Ihb received a personal summons from Emperor [[Anyr]]. The Emperor, impressed with the tales of the captain's prowess behind a ship, wished to recruit Ihb to be a pilot in the forces of [[Avsohm]]. Ihb accepted, and became an airship pilot with the Avsohmic military, taking him to even more faraway places.
