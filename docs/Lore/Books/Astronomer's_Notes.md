This book can be found on a lectern in the observatory atop [[Naharja]]. It documents the orbit cycles of the known lunar bodies, but notes a new celestial body, which the author believes to be a new star, orbiting Lo'Dahr several times a day. This may be the [[Aphelion]].

## Transcription
> Most of the objects in the night sky follow a standard progression, with each star taking exactly a day to circle to its previous position. The moons are synchronized to the Torahn, with Lorahn orbiting antipodal to it. Loruhn and the hidden moon Lo'Veruhkt orbit every fourteen days.
>
> However, I've sighted an unusual star the past few weeks. It is *exceedingly* dim, barely noticeable with the naked eye, and difficult to sight even with a telescope as powerful as mine. It whizzes around Lo'Dahr much faster than any star, several times per day.
>
> Even stranger still, the star appears to blink! Its brightness waxes and wanes even faster than it orbits. I must admit, I have no explanation for its behavior. It is completely unlike any other object I've ever seen.

## Extras

While this book claims that Loruhn and Lo'Veruhkt complete a full orbital cycle every 14 days, they actually complete a cycle once every 16 days in-game.
