## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in the underground section of [[Teiruun Monastery]] in the same room as Immortal Monk Shi'en, showing that the attempts at ascending [[Drehmari]] into [[Virmari]] without [[Virtuo]] have failed.

## Transcription
> Ugh, another failure. I just don't know why these corpses aren't co-operating! At this point I've tried so many techniques I can barely remember what I was trying to do in the first place. Dismemberment, trepanning, application of poison, ingestion of toxin, freezing, sensory deprivation... It all just leads to death. I am convinced that this is a fools errand, and that there truly is no mortal path to the greatness of Virmari.

> My last experiment will be on myself.

> Virtuo forgive me.
