## Transcription
> Ah, Maehrn'Vhos! The great wall of the west, constructed by an empire long forgotten, only within the deepest pages of the oldest libraries! Great Tharhan, the predecessor to the weak Tharxax, made the great wall to fend off invaders into their vast, fertile land! Their first challenger, the ancient Casain Empire, failed to pass this impenetrable barrier! Their second challenger, the Kingdom of Western Merijool, could not even approach the battered plains before it! With our own enhancements, our own reinforcements, we will bring justice to the greatest wall in the realm! All will cower before us, all who wish to travel the old western roads!
