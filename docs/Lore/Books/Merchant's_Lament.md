### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in an item frame in the northern extent of [[The Carmine]], noting new tariffs imposed by [Maelihs].

### Transcription:
> Maelihs announced an upping of tariffs today. Unfortunate, considering the recent shipment of gems from Ebonfire. But it's a small price to pay for our relative independence. Those poor saps in Rhaveloth don't know how bad they have it.
