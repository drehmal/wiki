 

This book can be found in a chest in a manor on the outskirts of [[Eloa]], containing one last message from the noblewoman who last inhabited the manor. She and her family fled Eloa after [[Maelmari]] forces began to re-assert control over the area, and leaves the hall and the [[Artifacts#Sharksbane|Sharksbane]] artifact to whoever finds this book.

> Dear Stranger,

> We're penniless and destitute. All the people of Eloa are gone, moved to Mohta, Tharxax, and who knows where else. Grandfather assured us that Maelihs would never return after Master Vahid's victory in the Carmine. Finally, the House of Ayre would be free to fly its Tahvan banners of nobility, while Eloa would again be able to ship out yellowroot across all the ports of the East.
>
> But, of course, nothing worked out. Grandfather swallowed a fish bone and died. Vahid left, and Insohm seemed to collapse overnight. And then those damned Maelmari collectors came back. Even I am a little surprised about how quickly things turned for the worse.
>
> At this point, we're leaving everything behind and going as far east as our legs can carry us. Feel free to take our hall and ancestral weapon if you want it. Both are nothing but a curse. It's clear now that we were doomed the first day that Burnt General showed up.

> Yours,
> Lady Helene Ayre
