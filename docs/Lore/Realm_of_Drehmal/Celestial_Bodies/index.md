# Celestial Bodies of Drehmal

> The three moons visible in Drehmal's night sky: Lorahn (left), Loruhn (center), and Lo'Dahr (right).

Outside of the [[disc]], five other celestial bodies make up the realm of Drehmal: the [[Torahn]], and four moons—[[Lorahn]], [[Loruhn]], [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], and [[Lo'Veruhkt]].

## Torahn

![[torahn.png]]{ width="300" }

The [[Torahn]] is the name of the sun in Drehmal. Mechanically, this sun is a simple re-skin of the vanilla Minecraft sun. However, it may hold a bizarre secret...

## Lorahn

> Lorahn in the night sky.

[[Lorahn]] is the closest moon to Drehmal, and arguably the most important to the life of an average Drehmari. It replaces the vanilla Minecraft moon, moving from east to west in the sky at night, directly opposite the [[Torahn]] (sun). Lorahn takes on a standard appearance similar to Earth's moon, although lore-wise it changes colors in 5-day cycles.

## Loruhn

> Loruhn in the night sky.

[[Loruhn]] is a moon which is always (somewhat) visible from Drehmal. It can just barely be seen during the day as a faint white spot in the sky, but at night, it lights up with auroras on its surface. These are depicted by green, blue, and purple lines wrapping around the center of the moon.

Loruhn orbits in a 16-day cycle around Drehmal, starting due north at the dawn of the first day and moving clockwise.

## Lo'Dahr

![[lodahr_nightsky.png]]{ width="300" }
> Lo'Dahr in the night sky.

[[LD|Lo'Dahr]] is a stationary moon located south of Drehmal, which can be seen over the southern horizon every night. It glows a bright yellow in the night sky, but cannot be seen in the daytime.

Lo'Dahr is the historical home of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), ruled over by the Great Sea Aspect, Abyssal Elder [[Dahr]], from whom it takes its name.

## Lo'Veruhkt

[[Lo'Veruhkt]] is the fourth moon of Drehmal. To most, its existence is nothing more than a rumor, but it does indeed exist. It follows a similar orbital pattern to Loruhn, but cannot be seen from Drehmal at all, being located physically beneath the disc. 

Lo'Veruhkt is a very mysterious place, worshipped by the peoples of [[Veruhkt Plateau]] and home to [[Rihelma]].

??? danger "SIGNIFICANT POST-75% SPOILER"
    During and after the 75% event on the [[Aphelion]], players can view Drehmal from space, allowing for up to 3 celestial bodies to be seen around the disc at once. This is also the only way to see Lo'Veruhkt.

        ![[night9_disc_system.png]] 
    At 00:00 on Day 9 (the very start of Day 9), all 5 celestial bodies are aligned in a vertical plane: Lo'Dahr sits between Drehmal and Loruhn in a total eclipse, while Lorahn is directly over the disc and the Torahn is directly beneath it. Lo'Veruhkt rests directly beneath Drehmal (possibly behind or in front of it), between the underside of the disc and the Torahn.
