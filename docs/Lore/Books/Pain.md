## Transcription
> Although all of the Primal Emotions are fundamental to the soul, Pain could be described as the most basic. Pain is induced in a soul via the presence of negative stimuli. Pain motivates a being to distance itself from said stimuli, usually as fast as possible. Like all Primal Emotions, Pain causes a release of Primal Energy. By torturing subjects, we are able to generate, extract, and store large amounts of Primal Energy.
