## Previous Lore

Most information on the Verdant Mistress comes from an [outdated official lore document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTHkp2cgMyqNtAEpwHSMpE9_vZ1xycq-GQltz9kNBh0/edit?usp=sharing), which asserts that the Verdant Mistress was one of the few known people in Drehmal's history to wield the power of "unlimited potentia", alongside the [[Tide Queen]] and [[Homli Tahsgan]]. The Verdant Mistress is said to have used her effectively infinite arcane power to turn a portion of the mountain range into a natural labyrinth, with constantly shifting mountains to prevent the armies of [[Maelihs]] from entering the East. This would likely place her first period of activity in either the [[Deity War]], the ancient Av2 conflict between Maelihs and [[Virtuo]], or shortly before/during the [[Tidal War]] in late Av3.

This same document also asserts that the Verdant Mistress, being a mythically powerful magic user, had one of the largest cult followings in Drehmal for a time, with some people worshipping her as the most benevolent of the great arcanists.

## Current References

No written lore about the Verdant Mistress exists in [[Drehmal v22|the current version of Drehmal]], but her name does appear twice in-map. A small structure can be found in the eastern Verdant Labyrinth, with a sign that reads "SHRINE TO THE VERDANT MISTRESS" and a generic loot chest.

The second is more substantial, as the Verdant Mistress is one of the four people who have a statue inside of the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. This seems to imply that she may have been a [[Virmari]], as well as being a part of Virtuo's Grand Parish.
