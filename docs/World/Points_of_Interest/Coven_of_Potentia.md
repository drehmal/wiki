# Coven of Potentia

![[coven_of_potentia.png]]

The **Coven of Potentia** is an [[Insohm|Insohmic]] castle on the eastern coast of the Shattered Peninsula, the large islands southeast of [[Spearhead Forest]]. It is home to the [[Artifacts#Nullblade|Nullblade]] artifact, a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Agony|Stone of Agony]], and **Rhalon**, the First [[Burnt Generals|Burnt General]].

## Layout/Walkthrough

The Coven is located on a small island, east of the large islands that make up the Shattered Peninsula. The bridge to the main facility is partially broken, similar to the [[Insohmic Library]] tower.

Once inside, players can turn right to loot the upper floors, which do not contain much of note besides the [[Councilman's Fears]] book.

Down the stairs near the entrance, players will find more rooms, eventually leading to a stone spiral staircase further down. This leads to an iron door, and a room with several pillars.

In this room, as players make their way across to the chiseled stone bricks on the far wall, **Rhalon**, the First Burnt General, will suddenly spawn, attacking the player. Rhalon is rather notorious as a jumpscare, appearing just before players reach the wall with a loud noise and two more Maelmari.

She will open with the line "YOU WILL DIE TODAY, REMNANT OF AVSOHM! RAAAAGH!"

Rhalon has three more dialogue lines:

66% Health: <br>
> GLORY IN FLAME!

33% Health: <br>
> BURN, SNAKESPAWN! BURN!

Death: <br>
> MY RADIANCE... I have failed you...

On death, she drops her helmet (player head) and the [[Artifacts#Rhalon's Chestplate|Rhalon's Chestplate]] artifact.

With Rhalon cleared, players are free to enter the larger portion of the Coven of Potentia, built underneath the castle. Here, on the lower floors, players will find a series of rooms that were home to the Chosen of the Coven.

These rooms hold three notable pieces of loot: [[The Origins of Red Dawn]] lore book, the [[Artifacts#Nullblade|Nullblade]] artifact, and a [[Fervor Stones#Stone of Agony|Stone of Agony]].

## Lore

The Coven of Potentia was a creation of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], the Third Avihm's defining power. In their quest to return to the Drehmari glory days of [[Avsohm]], they relentlessly pursued alchemical knowledge, and this location was built to study [[potentia]]. Here, they gathered their "Chosen", people deemed to have high potentia, and studied them, under threat of violence.

The Coven of Potentia is mentioned by the warden of [[Shatterhorn Gulch]] in [[Warden's Journal|his journal]] as having achieved their goal, subsequently turning someone into a "fiery maniac". It is not entirely clear who or what action this refers to.

Based on the [[Councilman's Fears]] book found here, the Coven was active until at least Av3 847, when [[Castle Hovadchear]] disappeared, meaning it has been abandoned for no longer than ~150 years.
