# Artifacts

Artifacts are unique items that have custom names, descriptions, stat modifiers, and often **Enchantments**. Artifacts are found scattered across the map, typically in chests, and their descriptions often explain lore surrounding the place they are found. Artifacts are denoted by the word "Artifact" in light blue in the item's description.

Artifacts, unlike [Legendary Items](/Items/Legendary_Items/) and [Mythical Weapons](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/), cannot be crafted, and are found only one time in a given instance of the map. Therefore, if an artifact breaks or is lost, it cannot be regained without the use of very specific commands.

Artifacts are found throughout the map, from the very first areas accessible to the player all the way to the end-game. On this page, artifacts are sorted alphabetically within the area where they are found. Most artifacts can be found on [[Overworld|Drehmal]] through exploration of its open world, but there are also some which are found in a separate late-game area, unlocked after the 75% network linkage event. Artifacts found in the open world are listed first, making up most of the list. Artifacts found in the latter location are listed at the end of this page, under "Post-75% Artifacts." 

Artifact descriptions themselves typically do not contain spoilers, as they lean more towards additional lore information than important main storyline information, so artifacts are not separated out by lore relevance. Rather, artifacts with additional lore behind them will have an additional "Extra Lore" dropdown, containing known background information on the artifact or information that it provides toward larger pictures in Drehmal.

!!! warning "Like other unique items in Drehmal, artifacts are intended to be discovered as you explore the world. If you would like to discover these unique weapons, tools, and armor pieces for yourself, you should not continue reading this page."

## Open-World Artifacts

These artifacts can be found at any time through exploration of the continent of [[Overworld|Drehmal]].

| **Lore**   | There is no question as to what makes a god, but to the common clay of civilization, what other way to describe the Harbinger of Calamity than a god? To see Her crest over the edge of the realm, knowing that you are now destined. Destined for ruination. |
| **Obtain** | Located in southern [[Anyr'Nogur]], in a large magma field. Chest located at **(-3571, 71, 3349)**             |

??? note "Extra Lore"
    Absolute Ruin is found beneath a chiseled taihryte brick in the center of a field of magma block, in southwestern Anyr'Nogur. If viewed from high up enough, this field takes a shape very similar to a manta ray, which is believed to be the approximate form of the [[Skullmother]], an immensely powerful beast utilized by [[Maelihs]] in his conquest of the West. The Skullmother is also the creature that caused the Desolation of the [[South Heartwood]], turning it from a dense forest to a completely barren wasteland, and this item appears to be describing the sight of the Skullmother approaching.

| **Obtain** | Located at the top of the [[Insohmic Research Center]], in the [[North Heartwood]]. Chest located at **(1956, 103, 1497)** |

??? note "Extra Lore"
    This seems to reference the departure of [[Ultva]] for the [[Avsohmic Vault]], where he would go insane. Insohm's inability to replicate this Avsohmic technology seems to have been the final straw that broke his spirit.

| **Obtain** | Located in a hidden side room in [[Azimuth Labs]]. Chest located at **(3194, 88, -556)**   |

??? "Extra Lore (Expansive)"
    Leliouria completely handicaps the player, making them functionally unable to move while on the ground, dropping them to a half heart of health, and making their attacks effectively useless.

    Leliouria is an incredibly unique artifact reportedly found by [[Red Dawn]] during a "far-flung expedition," likely the manned expedition to Eastern [[Xivrhynt]] that occurred late in [[Avsohm]]'s reign, as described in the [[Expedition Team Log]] book. 
    
    The term "Leliouria" refers to a somewhat obscure classification of demon as described by the real-world 11th-century Byzantine theologian Michael Psellos. Leliouria are his highest classification of demon, inhabiting "the ether beyond the moon". This very strongly mirrors the lore of Drehmal's universe, in which ascension could be obtained by conquering the "Spheres," likely referring to a form of astral projection to each of the moons.

    Only the Lore text referencing the "far-flung expedition" is legible in-game, with lines of dark red obfuscated text between them. These lines can be read, however, through commands. They read as follows:

    I CANNOT BELIEVE. THE IDIOT! THE IDIOT! THE IDIOT! BUT A MOCKERY. NOTHING MORE! NOTHING MORE! I AM THE FIRST. NO ONE BEFORE ME. NOT ONE. NO SOUL. NONE! PAIN. FEAR. PLEASURE. ALL OF ONE. ALL MINE. ALL. I SHALL BECOME. TO BE UNBOUND. MY RIGHT. MY RIGHT! TO EXISTENCE! TO BE NO MORE! TO BE UNDEATH! TO BE

    It is widely believed that this obfuscated text comes from [[Aok]], the same source as the [[Mt._Yavhlix_Dialogue.md|dialogue]] within Mt. Yavhlix.
