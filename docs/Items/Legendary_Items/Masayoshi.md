**Masayoshi** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The blade of the [[Tide Queen]], Masayoshi is a legendary weapon found in [[Firteid]]. It is a relatively strong legendary weapon, whose primary drawback is that it deals damage to its user as well.

## Gameplay
Masayoshi is an NBT-modified iron sword, inheriting the durability of a vanilla iron sword.

Masayoshi encourages a somewhat aggressive playstyle with decent attack damage, high attack speed, and a movement speed bonus. 

Its primary mechanic comes from its unique ability, Bloodletting, which deals 1 damage (0.5 hearts) to the player each time that it hits an enemy.

## How to Obtain
Masayoshi is found in the city of [[Firteid]], where its owner ruled for centuries.

The legendary weapon is found underneath the Tidal Palace, the largest building in Firteid, at the western end of the city. From the front entrance to the palace, turn right into the Palace Staff Quarters, then left down a cobblestone hallway to a blackstone wall with chiseled blackstone bricks. Digging through this wall reveals a chasm, leading down to a dark cavern. On the northern wall of this cavern is a structure that leads to a few rooms, including one at the very back with the trapped chest holding Masayoshi.

## Lore
Masayoshi's item description implies that it was wielded by the Tide Queen herself over the course of her millennia-long rule over the [[Tidal Dynasty]], and that it was crafted by a [[Sahd|Sahdan]] blacksmith. Since the Tide Queen was born with the ability to regenerate her own cells, the sword's curse (reflected by its special ability) effectively had no impact on her.
