This page contains information on smaller [[Tehrmari]] lore figures who do not have enough information to warrant full pages.

## Cehris Stonebreaker

Cehris Stonebreaker was born a [[Drehmari]] in Tharhan, stated to be a gigantic warrior from a farm. He obtained ascension to La'Tehrmari after defeating the avatar of [[Taihgel]] in an arm wrestling competition, and served as [[Sereven]]'s deputy in the Talon. He wielded the [[Artifacts#Continent Crusher|Continent Crusher]] artifact.

Cehris is deceased, and may have been one of the members of Sereven's Claw assassinated by [[Yriel]].

## Malka Gorrhys

Malka Gorrhys was the Speaker of [[Arkeje]], the youngest person to ever be elected its leader. A prominent Ro'Tehrmari voice, Malka's disappearance is the inciting incident behind the events of [[The Augury]], in which a group of young Tehrmari seems to witness her being killed in [[Sereven]]'s Coup.

## Ya'Kruul

Ya'Kruul, referred to sometimes with the title "Ya'Kruul of the True Way", is mentioned as a hero of the [[Divine Schism]] in [[Biography of Dragon Rider Oriann]]. They are also mentioned in [[Dread of the Ageless]] as having witnessed the destruction of the [[Ring Facility|Avsohmic Ring Research Installation]] firsthand during the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's violent collapse]], leading an expedition into the facility after its inhabitants were wiped out by an eldritch monstrosity. This suggests that Ya'Kruul may have been a disciple of [[Khive]], or at least lived in his domain.

The former book states that Ya'Kruul is deceased.
