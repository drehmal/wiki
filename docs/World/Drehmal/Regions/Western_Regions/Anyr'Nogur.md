# Anyr'Nogur

![[AN_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Anyr'Nogur** (pronounced "an-eer no-jure") is a region on [[Overworld|Drehmal's]] western coast, mostly made up of desert. Its name comes from early [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] times, when House Anyr held semi-autonomous control over the region. The word "Nogur" is likely [[Rihselch]] for "land" or "desert".

## Geography

Anyr'Nogur is located in the far west of the continent, next to the ocean. The region borders the [[Ebony Veldt]] to the north and [[Nimahj Swamp]] to the east. It is also connected to [[The Carmine|the Carmine]] to the south by a small land bridge, spanning a strait between the ocean and a gulf.

The vast majority of Anyr'Nogur is covered in lifeless desert, broken up by a few small oases. Its terrain is characterized by many bluffs, plateaus and canyons, with red, brown and yellow striped cliffs. In sharp contrast with the desert, the area along the coastline is lush and green, with many jungle trees and steep, orange-brown cliffs. A scattering of tiny, rocky islands can be found off the shore. The landscape of the region's southern portion appears burnt and scarred, similar to some parts of the [[South Heartwood]].

On the southwestern beaches, the sand is colored pink.

- Dried, sandy bed of Lake Nimahj in northeast <br>
- Lush, rocky shores with jungle trees in west <br>
- Desert with rainbow-colored, striped sand in south <br>
- Area with charred ground, trenches and lava pools in south

There are no settlements in Anyr'Nogur.

## History

For most of the Second Avihm, modern-day Anyr'Nogur (or at least the desert portion) was referred to as the "**Golden Sands**". The first known political state to have probably held land in the region was the [[First Tharhan Empire]]. After it eventually collapsed due to internal strife, [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six separate Tharhan kingdoms]] were formed, including Avakea. Avakea's inhabitants primarily settled oases in the Golden Sands.

Centuries later, likely in the Av2 1400s, settlers from the [[Casain Empire]] started to develop colonies on the region's western coastline. Casai's desire to expand their domain culminated in the [[War of Unification]], when the kingdom of Avakea was destroyed by Casain forces as part of an attack on the disjointed Tharhan states. The conflict ended with the Nightwalkers of [[Caer Adacia]] defeating the Casain Empire and conquering all six kingdoms, establishing the [[Second Tharhan Empire]]. As specified by the peace treaty, Casai was allowed to keep territory in the Golden Sands, while Tharhan likely still ruled over a section of the region. A Casain military camp, which had been set up atop a plateau in the region's center during the war, grew into the metropolis of Azen'Nath during the empire's reign.

Almost two centuries after the War of Unification, the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] took over the territory of both the Second Tharhan Empire and Casain Empire by mostly nonviolent means. With the region now fully subjugated under the empire, the land was allotted to House Anyr, who ruled semi-autonomously from Azen'Nath (referred to by Avsohm as Sal'Iloh). The city's [[Voynahla]]-based culture was shunned by the nobility, and it was renamed to "[[Sal'Anyr]]" after the ruling house. Sal'Anyr rose to great importance after the Anyr family's head, [[Anyr|Uffeihl Anyr]], was crowned the third emperor of [[Avsohm]]. He commissioned Sal'Anyr as a massive military stronghold to combat [[Empire of Maelihs|Maelihs's empire]] to the south, and he chose to live there instead of [[Av'Sal]] in order to personally lead his troops.

After most of Avsohm's government and military were [[Fall of Avsohm|wiped from existence]] at the end of the Second Avihm, [[Maelihs]] (using the [[Skullbeasts]]) destroyed Sal'Anyr and conquered the region along with the rest of the West in the [[Dune Wars]]. Anyr'Nogur continued to be ruled under the Empire of Maelihs until the [[Battle for Drehmal]], in which the region was most likely liberated by the [[Insohm|Insohmic Coalition]] and designated as territory to one or multiple Insohmic member states.

When the Order of Insohm fell at the end of the Third Avihm, Anyr'Nogur once again fell into the hands of Maelihs, and it continues to be reigned over by his empire into the present day.

## Terminus Tower

Anyr'Nogur's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] stands amidst the ruins of Sal'Anyr. Its lower section is enclosed within a tall, sandstone structure, and a staircase winding around its outer walls and above it leads partway to the tower's top before stopping short. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Avsohmic Launch Site

On Anyr'Nogur's northwestern coast is a structure that was used as a secret launch site for space shuttles traveling to and from Avsohm's flagship, the [[Aphelion]]. It was also commissioned as a base for an expedition to Western [[Xivrhynt]], after attempts to explore Eastern Xivrhynt were abandoned due to unforeseen danger. It is home to the [[Expedition Team Log]], the only detailed depiction of either Xivrhynt continent.

### Casain City Ruins

On the region's western coast are the ancient, red sandstone ruins of a Casain city. It was created during the Casain Empire's period of southward expansion after their failed attempt to conquer Western [[Merijool]]. The [[Artifacts#Coup de Grace|Coup de Grace]] artifact is found here.

### Rainbow Desert

A large span of desert in the southern portion of Anyr'Nogur is filled with rainbow-colored sand patterns, centered around a rainbow pyramid. This land is inhabited by rainbow (jeb) sheep, and is almost exclusively referred to within the community as the "Gay Desert". The pyramid at the center of the sub-region holds a single chest with a re-named and re-textured golden apple, the **Gay Apple**.

### Ruins of Sal'Anyr

[[Sal'Anyr]], originally called Azen'Nath or Sal'Iloh, was large Casain city built of sandstone across the top of a tall plateau in the middle of Anyr'Nogur's desert. It evolved from a military camp that was established by a Casain legion who secretly traveled into the region, preparing for an ambush, during the War of Unification. The city was later incorporated into the Avsohmic Empire, where it was placed under the partial jurisdiction of House Anyr. When Uffeihl Anyr became emperor, he moved his seat of power to the city and he commissioned it as a base of military operations against Maelihs. Sal'Anyr has lain in a state of utter ruin since its destruction by Maelihs and the Skullmother during Avsohm's fall at the end of the Second Avihm, although the giant pyramid that was once used as a mausoleum for the Anyr family still stands tall.

### Solitary Runic Blacksmith

In the region's southern desert is a sandstone house that belongs to a [[Runic Blacksmith]] selling [[Artisan Items#Anyr'Nogur|three artisan items]], who can be found in a small area behind the building. This smith's mother was well-known and respected by the Insohmic Coalition, and she worked in the Insohmic colonies of the West during the Battle for Drehmal. However, she suddenly left to explore the ruins of Sal'Anyr, and was able to recreate Avsohmic armor from the scraps she found. She then taught her technique to her daughter (the house's current resident) before dying out in the desert.

### Temple of Dahroehl

The [[Temple of Dahroehl]] was a temple dedicated to Dahroehl, the [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects) of Freshwater, hidden within a canyon northwest of Sal'Anyr. Its architecture is heavily inspired by the real-life archaeological site of [Petra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petra) in Jordan, with the red sandstone temple being embedded in a cliff on the canyon's side. [[Hastily-Left Message|A book]] near the entrance left by an ill-fated treasure hunter points to [[Cryptic Ode|another, hidden book]], which was written by monks who once resided in the temple and outlines a puzzle that leads to rewards for those who are deemed as worthy. By doing this puzzle, the player can obtain two [[Runic Catalyst|runic catalysts]] and one special [[Artifacts#Mirage|artifact]].
