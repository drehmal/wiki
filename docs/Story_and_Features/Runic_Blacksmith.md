# Runic Blacksmiths

**Runic Blacksmiths** are unique, named villagers found throughout the world of Drehmal, who sell [[Artisan Items]]. 

Runic Blacksmiths are found in every [major town](/World/Settlements/Official_Towns/), as well as in some isolated locations. Almost all Runic Blacksmiths' locations are denoted by a striped blue/light blue wool pattern, whether in a tent, merchant stall, or other building.

Runic Blacksmiths sometimes also offer other items, such as armor trims and Runic Amplifiers.

For a full list of Runic Blacksmiths and details on the Artisan Items they sell, see the main [[Artisan Items]] page.

## Runic Amplifiers
Runic Amplifiers are items that can be bought at certain Runic Blacksmiths who sell advanced, diamond-level artisan armor sets. Runic Amplifiers can be purchased for 32 Scales and 4 [[Runic Catalyst|Runic Catalysts]] apiece, or for 32 of the regional currency accepted by that town's Runic Blacksmith. Runic Amplifiers can be traded alongside a piece of diamond armor, at these blacksmiths, for very strong artisan armor pieces.

## Armor Trims
Armor Trims can be obtained in Drehmal through trading with certain Runic Blacksmiths. Drehmal's resource pack gives armor trims custom textures to correspond with the areas where they are sold, but these do not actually change the pattern or vanilla mechanic underlying armor trims.

## Extras

Normally, Runic Blacksmiths are immune to any sort of damage and cannot be turned into zombie villagers, but they can be killed by a player in Creative Mode or turned into a witch by a lightning strike. In this event, special merchant villagers can be re-summoned by using commands.

See [[FAQ#Can Custom Villagers Be Respawned?|this FAQ section]] for a full list of these commands.
