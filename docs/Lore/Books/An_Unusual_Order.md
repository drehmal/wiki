> Solique is a veteran escort of caravans planning to bring a shipment of local dye to market at Firteid. She will pass through the wilds of the Heartwater and Mael’s Desolation, and plans to sleep out of doors for nearly two weeks. Allegedly, beasts have been attacking ever more frequently in the darkness as of late, and specialized weapons are required. Due to the difficulty of the request and presence of custom components in the order, additional payment is required.
