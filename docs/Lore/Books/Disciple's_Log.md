 

This book can be found in an item frame, at the bottom of a deep cavern in the [[Birthing Grounds]], and describes an obsessive disciple's arrival at the site, as well as an attempted ritual to summon a Bonechild. This disciple can be inferred to be [[Ossein]].

> Day 1: Arrival
>
> I had only heard whispers about this place, but it seems that they have not led me astray! Some would be satisfied by books or the remarkably well preserved specimens in Lorahn'Kahl or the Black Jungle, but I know that my Kiln was here: The Birthing Grounds. This is likely where all the Bonechildren were born, crawling out from these reeking holes to wreak beautiful destruction. Oh how I wish I could have been there as Father and our village were disemboweled by glistening bones just like these. The stench is so... wonderful.

> Day 2: Rite
>
> After spending the afternoon exploring and becoming more intimate with my surroundings, it was time to finally begin. I had brought the samples collected from Femura's corpse. After making a small hole, I placed them within the supple, fleshy ground. Then, I began to cut necromantic runes in a circle around the site, taking care not to fully complete them. I stand now, wiping the sweat from my brow and feeling the sweat beneath my feet. It is time to commence the ritual.

> Day 3: Aftermath
>
> The rite was glorious! I watched as the ground heaved and convulsed, and a tumorous mass pushed its tendrils out onto the vast plain. It yawned open at the base as if to release its offspring.
>
> But the rite was also disappointing. No living Bonechild, least of all my beloved Femura emerged. Tears streaming down my face, I entered and made my way to the back. At first I morosely scrabbled around in the dark, but eventually composed myself enough to cast my light spell. And then my sadness turned to wonder. I recognized these bones! They had all the distinctive features of Skullchildren. I recognized a scapula and a rib. And then, there at the back of the chamber, I found it. Curious fragments of bone, seemingly long-discarded, but incredibly and tantalizingly powerful. Had Femura led me here? Was this my destiny? I again became inconsolable.
>
> What should I do with these fragments? It is clear that I will need to give it some thought. This is a warm place, and not at all uncomfortable. I shall rest here and ponder my fate. Perhaps I shall even take a new name to represent my devotion. Oh, Femura. With this, perhaps I could wreak just as much destruction as you and your sisters. Or even your mother.
>
> I love you.
