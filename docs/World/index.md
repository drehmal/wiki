Drehmal is the main and by far largest dimension in the game. This is the dimension that you spawn in and spend most of your time. According to the lore, Drehmal is a jagged cone-shaped object, and the land lived on by people is its flat face. Some other off-map locations are also in the Drehmal dimension.

## [[Lo'Dahr]]

Lo'Dahr is the second most important dimension, similar to Drehmal but smaller and more alien-like, but still housing many points of interest and settlements. The player must visit Lo'Dahr to progress in the later story. Lore-wise, Lo'Dahr is one of Drehmal's five natural satellites, and it was colonized by the Aspects.

## Space ([The Aphelion[Aphelion]])

The space dimension is home to the Aphelion, a large spacecraft that serves as the location for a story event. In the lore, the [Terminus[Terminus Network]] is also in orbit with the Aphelion, but in-game it is in the Drehmal dimension (except for its docking bay).

## The Nothing

In the lore, the Nothing is a vast void that exists between all realms in the universe, and is full of primal energy. In the game, the player must visit a floating rock within the Nothing for a story event.

## Future Drehmal

The Future Drehmal dimension is a replica of small parts of Drehmal, but void of all life and covered in sand. The player must visit this dimension twice during the story.
