> My brethren,
>
> As I walk from my dwellings in the Skyship Quarter to this humble chapel each day, I often pass the grand facade of the Burnt Father's holiest temple. As I do, I always pause for a moment to say a brief prayer for the souls of the reviled heretics brought for offering before I continue on my way.
>
> For you see, brethren, just as we venerate the dancing flicker of the Brightwyrm's sacred flame, so too must we devote ourselves to our betrayed creator, Maelihs himself. It is said that the Burnt Father held great esteem for each of his Aspect forerunners, but held Lai in highest regard. Though he was badly disfigured by the cowardly fires of his own kin, accursed Virtuo, Maelihs saw that the Brightwyrm does not take sides, and admired the spontaneity and passion of our kin.
>
> Although Lai would never subject Himself to the call of any deity, we believe that by instructing His child, Infernal Lailoehn, to aid our Maelmari brethren in burning a grand swathe through this Realm with his imperfect terrestrial fire, He has lent His support to our people and to the Burnt Father's cause.
>
> Therefore, though we rightly spend much of our time in devout meditation over the mysteries and revelations in the pure chaos of our Sacred Flame, we should not lose sight of our secondary duty to Maelihs. While our creed prevents us from venturing into his holy sanctuary, we should still find the time to send our thoughts and prayers towards the deity which brought us the gift of Ascension.
>
> Brethren, this twin loyalty between the Burnt Father and the Brightwyrm responsible for his burning will be the crucible which forges our spirits into true Primal Souls. Do not take this duty lightly.
>
> Therefore, as you leave this place today, spend time meditating in purest pain with the heretics upon the coals in front of the Sepulchral Altar. Consider the divine tragedy of Maelihs's betrayal and his noble quest for control of the Realm which was denied to him. Finally, as always, ponder the revelations of the Sacred Flame and consider how they should inform your actions in service of both Maelihs and the universe itself.
>
> May the spark of divine inspiration light your path. Praise be the Brightwyrm Lai!
