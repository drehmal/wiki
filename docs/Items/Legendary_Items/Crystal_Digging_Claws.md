| **Lore**                      | Though very few have made their home on the isolated Islands of Dusk and Dawn, they are the sole producer of mendarum crystals, which are second in potentia only to rehntite among all minerals. This claw was designed by Insohmic artificers to efficiently dig around crystals for easier extraction. |

## Gameplay
The Claws are an NBT-modified diamond shovel, and inherit the base-level stats of that item, including durability and block breaking affinities.

The claws are enchanted with Efficiency VIII, making them able to effectively insta-mine almost all dirt/sand/gravel-type blocks. Their special ability, Runic Magnet, increases the player's pickup radius to approximately 8 blocks (from around 1 at baseline).

The claws are not designed for use as a weapon, but with their incredibly high attack speed, they do have a higher potential DPS output than a vanilla diamond shovel.

## How to Obtain
The Claws can be found on the [[Island of Dusk]]. In a large mine on the eastern side of the island, the player must descend through a series of platforms and ladders while fending off Crystal Mites, custom silverfish. The claws are found in a trapped chest at the end of the wooden path, in a small alcove.

**Coordinates:** (-1874, 47, -3805)

## Lore
The claws, as written in their item description, are an [[Insohm|Insohmic]] invention, designed to dig for extremely powerful crystals found on the Islands of Dusk and Dawn.
