This book can be found on a lectern in a small [[Drehmari]] camp in the tunnels beneath [[Voynahla's Domain]]. It is concerned with the relationship between the two main [[Tehrmari]] groups: the dominant La'Tehrmari and the oppressed Ro'Tehrmari. This manifesto calls for anti-Ro'Tehrmari discrimination to end.

## Transcription
> Time and again, the La’Tehrmari have proven they cannot be trusted. They say they will allow our people to live free from persecution, and then they hound us at every turn to take their Trials. hey say that we are equals as servants of the Aspects, but then we are denied service at their places of worship. They say that the Talon will protect our independent towns, and then they slaughter everything alive in Rohei.
>
> The Ro’Tehrmari will no longer stand for this treatment. The Aspects have shown through the actions of their Moonsworn that we are not to be cut down like animals for slaughter. When Yriel killed the Talon in Ytaj, they sent a message to the entire moon that Ro’Tehrmari are valuable. Even though we are not reverent, talented, or intelligent enough to be their immortal servants, we still matter.
>
> All of this considered, we now ask that the Scalebound act. Forbid intentional discrimination against our people. Teach that being a Ro’Tehrmari is not shameful. Allow Ro’Tehrmari to have a voice in making decisions where they live. The time for deliberation is over, and the time to make a better, kinder Lo’Dahr has arrived.
