**Emperor Anyr's Scepter** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

The scepter is a legendary weapon, notable primarily for its damage, max health boost, and ability, which gives its wielder a strength boost when on low health. It is found in [[Anyr'Nogur]].

| **Lore**                      | Before Anyr was Emperor, he was a successful military general. Thus, even apparently ceremonial items he carried contained powerful means of self-defense. Like his elaborate mausoleum, however, this scepter was discarded when it was no longer needed. |

## Gameplay
Anyr's Scepter is an NBT-modified golden sword, and inherits that item's very low durability, although its Unbreaking X enchantment makes the weapon still viable for regular combat use.

In combat, the scepter's ability activates when the player drops below 20% max health. The player is given a pulsating Entropic Decay (Wither) effect, indicated by swirling yellow and magenta particles around them. The effect, which is given in addition to Speed I, Resistance V, and Strength I, lasts for 5 seconds. If the player gets a kill during this time, they are returned to 40% HP and the effects are removed.

However, if no enemy is killed during this time, the player dies at the end of the timer.

## How to Obtain
Emperor Anyr's Scepter is found in the pyramid which served as his family mausoleum, in the west of [[Sal'Anyr]], the large mesa-top city in [[Anyr'Nogur]].

At the front entrance of the pyramid (entering from the town), which is partially buried in sand, the scepter is located at the end of the right (north) path, which is also accessible by dropping down into the staircase from the top of the pyramid. Beyond an arrow trap on the stairs, a spawner, and a wall with a chiseled quartz block, the player will find a room with a large tomb, containing a chiseled sandstone block on the front. Breaking this block will expose the trapped chest that holds this weapon.

## Lore
This weapon belonged to [[Anyr]], the final emperor of [[Avsohm]], and a central figure in the lore of Drehmal. As a general in Avsohm's military, Anyr was experienced in combat, and wielded the scepter as a deceptive weapon, which appeared ceremonial at first glance. The scepter was likely discarded towards the end of his reign, as Anyr became more powerful and aspired to become ascended.

[^1]: In older versions of Drehmal 2.2 (before August 2024), this weapon's ability simply gave the wielder Strength II when below 20% HP.
