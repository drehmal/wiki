# Six Tharhan Kingdoms

The **Six Tharhan Kingdoms** were a group of six independent kingdoms in [Western Drehmal](/World/Regions/Western_Regions/) that divided the Tharhan peoples between the reign of the [[First Tharhan Empire|First]] and [[Second Tharhan Empire|Second]] Tharhan Empires. They banded together to fight [[Casain Empire|Casain invaders]] during the [[War of Unification]], ultimately being conquered by [[Caer Adacia]].

Their story is largely told by the Tharhan: A Land of Conquest series, particularly the [[Tharhan A Land of Conquest (Chapter 2)|second chapter]].

## List

### Avakea

**Avakea** was a kingdom in modern-day [[Anyr'Nogur]], thriving as a center of mineral wealth and living near the oases of the region's great canyons. Avakea was destroyed by [[Casain Empire|Casain invaders]] during the [[War of Unification]], paving the way for Casain dominance of the region for centuries to come.

### Dehar

**Dehar** was a kingdom in the [[Mt. Ebonfire]] region. It was famed for its special Deharian steel, an extremely durable type of steel made through their unique metalworking process. No other civilization has since been able to recreate it, including [[Avsohm]]. This kingdom was conquered by the Nightwalkers of [[Caer Adacia]] at the end of the [[War of Unification]]. Under Avsohm, it became a province governed by House Vera.

Two artifacts in the map are supposed to be made of Deharian steel: the [[Artifacts#Deharian Longsword|Deharian Longsword]] in Mt. Ebonfire and the [[Artifacts#Marred Masterwork|Marred Masterwork]] in [[Sal'Lorahn]].

### Erxsival

**Erxsival** was a kingdom in the lowlands of [[South Tharxax]], known to have worshipped [[Maelihs]] during the Six Kingdoms period. It is likely that this kingdom was in control of [[Tharxax City]] (possibly still named Elthun at that time), as the arch over that city is called either High Arch or Erxsival Arch. 

Erxsival fell to the Nightwalkers in the War of Unification, and was appointed to the rule of House [[Anyr]] under [[Avsohm]].

### Loraga

**Loraga** was a strong kingdom in the highlands of [[North Tharxax]], likely centered around [[Loraga Keep]]. It was known for its particularly violent conflicts with its northern neighbor, Nimahj.

Loraga and Nimahj were annexed by the Second Tharhan Empire, and were both appointed to the provincial rule of House Silar under [[Avsohm]].

### Nimahj

**Nimahj** was another strong kingdom in [[North Tharxax]], centered around [[Fort Nimahj]]. It was known for its particularly violent conflicts with its neighbor, Loraga, and is a long-standing bastion of [[Virtuo]]'s faith.

Loraga and Nimahj were annexed by the Second Tharhan Empire, and were both appointed to the provincial rule of House Silar under [[Avsohm]].

### Salahnar

**Salahnar** was a kingdom in [[South Tharxax]] alongside Erxsival, named for the massive River Salah that runs through the region. 

Salahnar fell to Caer Adacia in the War of Unification, and was part of House Anyr's provincial domain under [[Avsohm]].
