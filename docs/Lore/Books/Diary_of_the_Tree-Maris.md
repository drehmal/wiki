## Transcription
> The treehouse is finally finished! And it can stand way more than our three weights combined, this tree is something else ! We're gonna go fetch some furniture to put in here, and we'll finally have our first proper night in our very own treetop house ! I have such wonderful friends.
>
> We heard sounds at night, and woke up in fear of being attacked, but nothing is here, it's below us: a horde of monsters, hiding in the forest. If we go down at night, who knows who will find our corpses... We'll wait for the day to come down for sure.
>
> Alright, things are worse than expected. The monsters hide under the trees, and are still numerous. And we finally found who would find our corpses if we died: cultists ! There are probably even some necromancers in there, and we do not want to end up as zombies. We've been stuck in here for a week now. We're gonna try to find a way to get supplies. Tonight, we'll stay on the treetops and try to scavenge for berries and fruits. Let's hope it works...
>
> It worked, we have a lot of food now, surviving shouldn't be a problem. However, Durha'an injured himself pretty severely, and if we don't do anything our friend will die... Plus, the food is going out very fast with the tree of us. We need to solve both problems now.
>
> Me and Sihl'vihn decided on something. We're gonna use Durha'an as bait to lure the monsters, then we'll escape this forest on the treetops. It's the only possible way.
>
> I've never really liked this person anyways.
