## Transcription
> Your Reverence Lord Ghian of the Naharja Scalebound,
>
> As you are aware, violent crime in violation of the Code has not historically been a major problem in Lo’Dahr. La’Tehrmari are hand-picked for their devotion to the Aspects by Wingmakers and then undergo extensive trials. And since almost no Ro’Tehrmari has the expertise in runic magic or arcanism to rival even a casual La’Tehrmari practitioner, few outside of combatants in the War of Generations have ever dared to raise a weapon against the Talon.
>
> I have run Okhran Prison since the end of the Schism, and it has always performed its function admirably. No prisoner has escaped, and no suicides have been allowed. But I have grown concerned. After the Great Purge, there have been more and more Ro’Tehrmari sent here from Naharja every year for violence, and capacity is critically low. They are growing bolder, and I fear that the crime wave may soon overwhelm Okhran Prison. To overcome it, I humbly ask you and the other Scalebound to either crack down on lawlessness or grant me sufficient funding to upgrade my facility.
>
> Humbly yours,
>
> Warden Desna Okhran
