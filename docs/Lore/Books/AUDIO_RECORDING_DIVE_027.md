### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Resonant Halls]]. It is a transcription of a conversation between [[Orix Cehein]] and [[Tethlaen]] through the Resonant Eye, from the 27th attempted dive. At this point, the two appear to have developed a strong rapport, and Tethlaen informs Orix that if at some point he is no longer able to hold the tear closed, primal energy will leak from the Nothing into Drehmal, causing the inevitable destruction of the realm.

### Transcription:

> [U1] Attention, Harbinger. Any interesting observations on your side today?
>
> [AR] Drehmari. It is good as ever to hear your voice. I witnessed a group of creatures like bundles of wire in a purpled fog swim as if one entity some time ago. Days mean nothing to me, as you must understand by now.
>
> [U1] Indeed. While I’d like to hear much more about what you have witnessed, I have more urgent questions in this call. The last time we spoke, you stated that you expect that the tear will be the death of our entire realm. I feel like YOU must understand that I cannot sit idly by with that revelation unexplained.
>
> [AR] Not many of my siblings would care for your tone. But I appreciate your straightforwardness, Drehmari. Our realm can only take in so much of the primal energy, the "something" in your “Nothing”, before it over-inflates and collapses. When I stated that the death of this realm is inevitable, I was merely making a prediction that one day I will break down and stop being able to keep my seal in place. You already mentioned once that my siblings Noha and Palaesida are dead. Why should I be any different? A creature of the void will overpower me, or I will lose my sanity for good. Our only hope is that one day my kin will find some way to truly heal the wound. I live for that hope, but I do not expect it.
>
> [U1] That is a lot to take in. Perhaps I will contact the Emperor and see if His Imperial Highness would relent to consulting with Khive. Would this be acceptable to you, Harbinger?
>
> [AR] Try what you will. He cares only for results. It would not be logical for him to interfere while I remain at my station.
>
> [U1] Unfortunately…
>
> [AR] Yes. I can tell. This dive is ending. But before you go, Orix Cehein, know this. You have my blessing. Whatever you do, I know it will be for the best interests of this realm.
>
> [U1] My thanks, Harbin-
