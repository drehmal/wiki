 

This book can be found in a chest on the central island of [[Av'Sal]]. Written by a Regionalist senator, it laments the newfound popularity of Emperor [[Anyr]], whose Centralist policies are sweeping Avsohmic elections and taking more power away from the individual regions.

## Transcription
> Well, our worst fears have come true. Emperor Anyr is wildly popular with the citizenship, not just of the cities, but amongst most rural and provincial areas as well. Only during the reign of Drehn Himself did a single Emperor hold so much sway over the people, and it shows in the elections. People are voting for Centralist candidates at a higher rate than ever before, and it's looking like their coalition will have a supermajority in the Grand Senate. Additionally, four of the six governorships are now helmed by Centralist candidates. This could be salvageable 50 years ago, but Emperor Anyr has done a thorough job at turning what was once a respectable political party into an outright cult of personality. I see dark days ahead for Avsohm.
