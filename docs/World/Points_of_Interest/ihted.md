# Ihted

The ruins of **Ihted** are located on the east bank of the river flowing from the Primal Caverns in the [[Central Valley]] [region](/Regions). Named after a city of the First Avihm now lost to time, they contain the Unnamed Ziggurat, the [[devotion]] shrine for Khive.

## Lore
This place, discovered by Avsohm under Emperor Ifeihl's reign, was once a hub of runic magic and Khive worship during the First Avihm.
Its story is mentioned in the book [[Annoyed_Archeologist's_Thoughts]]
