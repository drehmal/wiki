## Transcription
> Expeditions through Homli's Pass to the west have proved entirely unsuccessful. The Dreamer says the bird totems of the old cults point the way, but the snow through the pass has buried them entirely. We suspect that the one we've seen through the pass is the only one left in Faehrcyle.
>
> We'll have to stumble blindly through deep snow, frozen lakes, and intense blizzards for days if we're to find the dead mountain.
