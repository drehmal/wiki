>
> I knew it. That cursed mountain never should have been dug into. Avsohm is in the wrong to have ignored the words of the locals and wisemen of the realm. Here I am, atop Mt. Mekta, far away from their operation, and I see a great storm approaching. The clouds, advancing faster than any other. Streaks of primal, yellow light being cast down upon the world.
>
> Avsohm has angered something and thus we all will be punished for it.
