The peoples of Tahva are pirates and nomadic sailors who consider themselves an independent nation.

## Layout

Tahva is constructed between two islands, with a series of simple wooden ramps and bridges connecting the pieces of the small settlement, including a floating platform in the center. Three flags of gray and red fly in the settlement, likely depicting the town's custom banner.

The Tahva [[Runic Blacksmith]] is located at the top of the northern island, and sells [[Artisan Items#Tahva|one artisan item]].

## Lore

The Tahvan peoples do not stay in one place permanently, but rather, settle in different coastal areas and move their home as needed. Therefore, a settlement known as "Tahva" has likely existed in many different places throughout Drehmal's history, and this is just the current Tahva.

It appears that Tahvan peoples have spread throughout the southern coasts over time, including the noble family of [[Eloa]].
