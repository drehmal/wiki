### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Tharxax City]] Treasury room, in which a tax collector for [[Maelihs]] questions their dedication to the chaos deity after seeing life in Tharxax.

### Transcription:
> The longer I spend here in Tharxax, the more I question Maelihs. All my life, growing up in Rhaveloth, I've heard about the horrors of  being forced to become a cog in some perfect Virtuo-made machine. And yet, in a puppet city where even the wealthiest merchants must reap ever-increasing dividends in order to pay their obligatory duties to Lord Maelihs, it is hard to see the chaos of free life.
>
> The Lord Magister forces me to collect the taxes, but I usually can't bring myself to demand full payment. I truly pity these people. They throw rocks and stones at me, they fear me, they hate me. I understand why. I just wish it wasn't so.
>
> I'm only here for a few days more, until the Burnt Generals send my replacement. They said I'll get a promotion. Does that mean moving further into Lord Maelihs's sanctum? Will I get to serve the Rhaveloth Guard or even witness Lord Mael's fabled Burnt Palace?
>
> Although every bone in my body tells me to be excited about this opportunity, I'm not entirely sure if I even want to go.
