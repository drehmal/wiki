    Approximate Coordinates: `4881, 101, -3380`

## Layout/Features

In a blue tent just outside of the main building stands a [[Runic Blacksmith]] with a blue wool tent, selling [[Artisan Items#Shivering Pines Inn|two artisan items]].

A stable is found just to the west of the main building, with two horses inside and four empty stalls. Further to the west is a large shed with a [[Runic Catalyst]] on its top floor.

### Main Building

Upon entering the main building, players will find a bar with Brewmaster Ga'ran standing behind it (1). Ga'ran is a custom trader who offers three unique potions:

**Ga'ran Trades:**

|  **Cost**  | **Item** |
|:----------:|:---------------------------:|
| 14 Scales | Iceberg Stout <br> Effects: Slowness II (24s) <br> Regeneration III (40s) |
| 18 Scales | Sparkling Khivesbrew <br> Effects: Speed II (3m) <br> Jump Boost II (3m) |
| 27 Scales | Logger's Lager <br> Effects: Haste (4m) <br> Hunger (45s) |

The room behind Ga'ran is home to another named villager, Elmlhi. A book with her writing, [[Storm's Gathering]], is also found in this room.

A dining room is found on this ground floor as well, and a staircase to the right leads up to the second floor, home to 5 guest rooms.

A 1-block wide staircase labeled "Employees Only" leads up to Ga'ran and Elmlhi's bedroom, with the [[Brewmaster Ga'ran's Diary]] book found on a lectern. It hints at another Runic Catalyst in the attic, accessed from a balcony through the painting near the bed.

## Lore

This inn was founded somewhat recently by a couple, Ga'ran and Elmlhi, who came from somewhere to the south and established the lodge. Elmlhi had always dreamed of owning an inn, and Ga'ran used her talents as a master brewer to draw in guests by selling her specialty ales and lagers. By the time that the player arrives here, the couple have made a decent living for themselves, as one of the only notable points of interest in the Frozen Bite.

## Extras

### Trivia

An iron golem named "Tehrl" guards the inside of the main building.

***

On some versions, copies of the named entities from Shivering Pines could be found inside of the mountains about 400 blocks to the west.

### Merchant Respawn Commands

In the event that one of the custom merchants in Shivering Pines is turned into a witch or dies, the following commands can be used (through a command block) in order to respawn them. See [[FAQ#Can Custom Villagers Be Respawned?|this page]] for more information on these commands.
