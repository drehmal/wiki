> The Lordlady is a vain and fickle one, rarely deigning to speak with Her worshippers. But to this congregation's delight He has spoken directly to us not once, but thrice! This is unheard of, and worthy of immense celebration alone. And, wise as She is, He must have foreseen as much. We have been tasked with conducting rituals of utmost importance. Three great sigils must be constructed, formed with canals of flowing freshwater. The plans of the Lordlady are ambitious in scale, but we shall serve with devotion and zeal. Failure is unthinkable.
