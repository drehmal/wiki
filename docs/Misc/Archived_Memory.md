# Archived Memory

!!! warning "Side Content"
    This page concerns a piece of side content which is not a part of any mainline Drehmal map release. It does, however, come from the Drehmal dev team, and can likely be considered fully canon. The lore book contained within may only make sense if you have beaten [[Drehmal v22|version 2.2]], but it does not truly contain any real spoilers for the map.

On October 12, 2025, a world download was surprise-dropped by the [[Librarian|Unknown Librarian]] in the Drehmalcord `#announcements` channel. This world, a teaser for the [[Drehmal v23|Drehmal 2.3 update]], contained a few small region files highly reminiscent of the [[North Heartwood]]. The map is very small, and revolves overwhelmingly around the 58-page [[Ash-Stained Journal]] lore book, found at the end of the short path the player starts on.

The file was accompanied by the following message from the Librarian:

> Hello there, Seekers! It's been quite a while since I've spoken so publicly, but I have discovered a peculiarity with which I require some assistance.
> 
> Across the years, there has been very little to leave me stumped. However, I simply cannot abide an unsolved puzzle. While I pride myself on my independent research, some mysteries can only be solved with boots on the ground. And you, my friends, are some of the most capable boots (and brains!) that I know. 
> 
> So, for you my Seekers, I've gone and dusted off a brief memory from my personal archive for you to take a peek at. I apologize in advance, as it's little more than a fragment. If I had found more, I'd have brought more. So don't go expecting a grand adventure like last time, y'hear?
> 
> Within it lies an... interesting piece of literature. One that I suspect you will find just as interesting as I do.
> 
> Do get back to me soon, my curious and capable friends!

## Setup

The world can be downloaded from the [announcement posted in the Discord on October 12th](https://discord.com/channels/695817407557795910/713629838887616522/1426989167946104986). It can be played on any 1.21.6 installation, but the OptiBoxes mod is recommended for the specifically modified skybox.

When properly extracted into a saves folder, the save is titled "Ivelar the 15th of Dahrohma, Av2 1531"—a date in the late Second Avihm, the moment that this "memory" is set in.

The world has no datapacks or other required mods.

## Contents

When the player first loads this world, they will find themselves at the bottom of a hill, surrounded by dark oak trees similar to the [[North Heartwood]]. A faint path leads up the hill, with new blocks from Minecraft versions 1.18+ used in the terrain, such as petals and dead leaves on the ground, as well as cattails in the nearby river. The world is on Peaceful difficulty, with the daylight cycle not actively running. The time is set to 23:00 on Day 9. If the OptiBoxes mod is correctly installed, the regular Drehmal skybox will appear. The player spawns in Survival Mode, with cheats disabled.

The player spawns with a partially-full inventory, including:

- A lantern in the off-hand.
- Four pieces of leather armor, dyed green and with the "Flow" trim/emerald material applied. Each of these items is uniquely named, and has lore text seen below.
- 18 Emeralds (retextured to the Drehmal scales, but not renamed by the resources).
- 8 Arrows
- A plain vanilla iron axe in hotbar slot 1.
- A plain vanilla crossbow in hotbar slot 2.
- A plain vanilla rabbit stew in hotbar slot 7.
- 14 plain vanilla pieces of bread in hotbar slot 8.
- An emerald in hotbar slot 9, renamed "Green Serpent Medallion". Its lore text reads: "A rare opalescent scale inscribed with uniquely minted runes. Used to identify traveling Green Serpent deputies as such."

The armor pieces have lore as follows:

| **Armor Piece** | **Name** | **Lore Text** |
|:-------------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Helmet        | Deputy's Helmet | This light-weight helmet is made from spongy plant material covered in green cloth and adorned with many twinkling pieces of green glass. The brim is wide enough to protect the face and neck from the sun. It's a standard design, used by all Green Serpent deputies across the disk. Being quickly recognized as nothing more than a friendly merchant has its perks. |
| Chestplate | Emblazoned Coat | The coat of each Green Serpent deputy is unique to the trader in question. They're often somewhat ramshackle, with patches of various exotic fabrics gathered on their travels sewn on as a form of braggadocio. Pockets are abundant, and generally filled with junk. However, all Green Serpent deputies proudly wear their medallion of office upon the right breast. |
| Leggings | Loose Trousers | Airy enough to be breathable, yet heavy enough to keep warmth in when it matters. This style is old, originating from the Veruhkt Plateau, but has spread like wildfire and adapted to every possible climate by the orphic wanderers. The scaled trimmings along the seams shimmer faintly. |
| Boots | Tough Boots | Travel is rough on footwear. Thick, iron-riveted soles and layers of weatherproofed leather defy any jagged terrain. This, right here, is the true mark of a trader. Here is the rising spirit that never falters. Here is the striving that reaches past the horizon beyond what is possible. Here is what carried them into the unknown. |

Astute players may look to the sky and notice a new addition to the skybox: to the south-southwest, a large light blue cross has manifested next to Lo'Dahr, one which is never present in the main version of 2.2. This object is the central conceit of the map's main feature, a massive new lore book. Skybox image overlays have revealed zero other differences, large or small, between this skybox and the regular 2.2 Av4 skybox.

Following the path to the top of the hill, players will find the smoldering ruins of a small building, with two item frames on the ground: one containing a spyglass, and the other containing the [[Ash-Stained Journal]] lore book. This is the main feature of the map.

### Side Content

There is no true content beyond the path and book. However, the landscape is a nearly perfect match for the large mountain in the [[North Heartwood]] found just northwest of [[Gozak]]. The terrain is notably different, however, with new rivers and a greater variety of mushrooms than is seen in this same area in 2.2. This may represent a teaser for a larger Heartwood revamp in [[Drehmal v23|the 2.3 update]], or it may simply provide a glimpse into what the Heartwood's ecosystem used to look like in late Av2. The only other structure of note is a small deepslate aqueduct that runs off the eastern edge of the map, heading towards what would be Gozak.

## Lore/Implications

The Archived Memory delivers on the community expectation of more [[Green Serpent]] lore in 2.3, as the player steps into the shoes of a traveling merchant of Green Serpent in Av2 1531, discovering the ruins of this hilltop observatory and reading about its inhabitants' disturbing findings.

This specific date would place this memory within approximately one decade of the founding of [[Avsohm]] out of the [[Chosen Kingdom]], making this Heartwood one that is mostly untouched by the Empire, and still whole prior to the Desolation of the [[South Heartwood]] in early Av3. The exact political state of the Heartwood is not clear at this time, but it was likely ruled in part by Gozak and the Kingdom of [[Espinor]].

Notably, the title of the map's folder gives its day as "Ivelar". This follows the nomenclature of days of the week in Drehmal, but is not one of the days of the week that previously existed in other versions of the map via the [[(REMOVED) Calendar of Drehmal|removed Calendar of Drehmal book]]. This has been confirmed to be part of a finalized calendar system rewrite in 2.3.

The main book, [[Ash-Stained Journal]], focuses on the mysterious disappearance of stars from the night sky over the course of the late Av2 1400s and early Av2 1500s. The second astronomer eventually comes to the conclusion that stars are disappearing in a straight line, which is moving directly towards the realm of Drehmal. At this time, the exact nature of the stars was not known by Drehmari, and so this presented an unclear threat. However, as players who have finished the map will know, each "star" in the night sky is in fact its own realm, contained by its own [[Veil]] within the greater Drehmal multiverse. The new object in the skybox, which glows blue like the stars that are accelerating towards Drehmal, can therefore be understood to be whatever is causing the "stars" to disappear.

Due to the Memory taking place within the point of view of a Green Serpent officer, it can be assumed that Green Serpent was aware of this object and sought to investigate it further after the night recorded in the Archived Memory.

## Extras

If the `doDaylightCycle` gamerule is manually set to `true`, the blue object in the sky will begin to rotate around the skybox in a clockwise direction, following a similar orbital pattern to [[Loruhn]] (also on a 16-day cycle). Loruhn itself, conversely, completes a full cycle around the skybox every 24 hours, above the new blue star.
