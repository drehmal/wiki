## Transcription
> Almost directly north of the town of Okeke, not far from the northern seashore of the lovely forested land of Merijool, is a large pyramidal shrine. It has been many years since I last visited, but the friendly monks who keep the eternal sacred flame burning up there treated me to some delicious sap-fried escargot. Between the good eats and the beautiful scarlet trees, I cannot recommend visiting highly enough!
