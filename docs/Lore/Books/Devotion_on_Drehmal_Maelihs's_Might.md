## Transcription
> Though Lord Maelihs has always given permission for La'Tehrmari to come and go freely, it will be no easy feat for you to travel to the far southwest of the Carmine unrestrained. It will be harder, still, for you to enter the sprawling city of Rhaveloth and the Sepulchral Altar at its heart. If you manage all of that, however, you can still observe the brutally dramatic rituals of ascendance while munching on a spicy Rhavelothi meat pie.
