1. An official timeline from [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1]] places the creation of the Chosen Kingdom in Av2 1280 and its transition into the Avsohmic Empire in Av2 1535, although this timeline is no longer officially referenced anywhere and no date is given in the current version of the map.

The Chosen Kingdom was a kingdom located in the Central Plains during the Second Avihm, and the direct predecessor to the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]]. 

## History 

### Origins

The Chosen Kingdom originated in the Central Plains of Dreh'Noha (split into the [[Capital Valley]] and [[Gulf of Drehmal]] regions in-map) in the mid-late Second Avihm, a collection of smaller city-states in the area. The Chosen Kingdom and the people of Avsohm seem to claim ancestry from the people of [[Drahbes]], possibly indicating that the former was initially headquartered at this city.

### Fall & Reformation

Little is known about the full history of the Chosen Kingdom, but some details on its end are clear. The father of [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]] (1) was assassinated, giving Drehn the right to rule, but he initially refused this burden. Believing that the kingdom was too corrupt and not in line with his democratic ideals, Drehn eventually relented and took the crown, overhauling the kingdom into the Empire of [[Avsohm]].

1. Drehn's father was named "Rohdirk Mal'Sohm" in an old external lore source, but this name does not appear in-map.

## Culture

The Chosen Kingdom, being in the center of the continent during the Second Avihm, practiced worship of [[Drehmal]]. They notably ousted a group of "Lunar Necromancers" from their kingdom in Av2 1383, who would go on to settle in [[Lorahn'Kahl]] and create the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]].

The Chosen Kingdom seems to have had an extremely powerful aristocracy, as one of the reasons Drehn is stated to have turned down the crown was the influence of the wealthy on its government. In [[A Retrospective]], [[Thresa Vera]] mentions that her family was one of the original five wealthiest houses in the Chosen Kingdom, showing that the powerful and wealthy families in the Kingdom maintained their influence well into the reign of Avsohm.
