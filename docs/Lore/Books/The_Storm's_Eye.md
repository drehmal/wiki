This book can be found in a chest in [[Naharja]], on the second floor of the building home to Adventuring Merchant Eliana. It refers to the Heart of the Tempest in [[Palaesida's Domain]], which was once a sea but dried after the death of [[Palaesida|its Aspect]].

> In the far southeast of the habitable area of our Divine Moon there lies a sea, now long-dried. It was once fed by the torrential storms which raged over Palaesida's domain, but now lies dry and lifeless as its benefactor. Legend has it, somewhere in that ancient basin ringed in cyan and orange, there is a traditional meeting spot of the Ro'Tehrmari known as the Storm Eye. It was there that the Republic of Arkeje was born.
>
> Though Ro'Tehrmari today are not nearly as bold—after all, with our greater numbers we have a reasonable share of the bounty, even here in Naharja—I would still one day like to venture to the Eye. Legend has it that a treasure was buried there under a discolored stone.
>
> To stand in that lofty aperture and gaze across the salted flats... it doesn't seem too far-fetched that I might still hear the fervent cries of our ancestors assembled below!
