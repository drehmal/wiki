# Crimson Gorge

![[Crimsongorge1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Crimson Gorge** is a semi-region in southwest [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Despite not having a tower, it can be considered separate from other region's because of its unique terrain, which serves as an obstacle for passage between [[The Carmine|the Carmine]] and the [[Hellcrags]].

## Geography

The Crimson Gorge area consists of a large plateau scored with a labyrinthine network of deep canyons, with entrances/exits at [[Rhaveloth]] in the Carmine and the Hellcrags. The canyon floors are made up of mostly red and orange sand, while the ground on top of the plateau also has elements of black and gray. The tall cliffs flanking the canyons and at the sides of the plateau are mostly black with red and gray stripes. There are some pools and trenches of lava, and no living vegetation can be found in the area.
