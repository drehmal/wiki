> I write to you from far, far away. I was rounding the Island of Dawn on the way home when I ran into my publisher, Soli. She had been searching far and wide to find me and my latest writings and was as heated as a tiger shark. But when the seas finally calmed aboard the Surly Duchess, she told me quite the tale!
>
> I hear that many back home know the name of Devro Ihb, and that my adventures have inspired several other youngsters to set off on adventures. I have a few things to say to you!
>
> First, know that I am truly grateful. Though I’m sure Soli and her editors do a good job glamorizing my deeds, being the steersman of a seafaring craft is not an easy job. The recognition I’ve received is flattering, and it fills my old heart with courage.
>
> Second, and this one’s to the parents of those kiddos, I’m sorry. Sounds like they have been quite a handful. But I do encourage you to let them loose just a bit. Ours is a time of relative safety, and keelhaul me if seeing the world is not the noblest thing a person can do!
>
> Third, and last, I have a few words for my old ma and pa. I left never intending to see either of you again, and I’ve never looked back until now. If you are still kicking, know that I have grown into my boots and my beard. I’m a strong man now, experienced, wise, and kind. I hope that you can come to see that.
>
> To all: My next journey will be to visit you in Kazzani, and after that, I shall leave on my greatest adventure yet.
>
> (Though I would like to use a different sendoff, I feel like the kids would get a kick out of this one! Here goes.)
>
> Always beyond!
