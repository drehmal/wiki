This book can be found in a chest in the [[Resonant Halls]]. It is a transcription of a conversation between [[Orix Cehein]] and [[Tethlaen]] through the Resonant Eye, from the sixth dive. It establishes that Tethlaen entered the Nothing of his own will, as he felt that he would only be able to hold the tear closed from the inside, protecting the realm of Drehmal.

\*U1 = User 1 (Orix)

\*AR = Audio Receptor (Tethlaen)
> [U1] Attention, Harbinger. This is Chief Observer Cehein. Can you hear me?
>
> [AR] Indeed. Your people have finally finished their work, and I am alone again.
>
> [U1] I am here to test the improved audio receptor. I can hear you clearly now.
>
> [AR] It is funny. I used to hate when duty forced me to interact with Drehmari. Now, I feel your people are the last thread supporting my sanity.
>
> [U1] Our thread is not as flimsy as you might think. Avsohm is working to make this realm safer.
>
> [AR] That brings me joy. You Drehmari have such.. pluck. I truly miss talking to you.
>
> [U1] You’re welcome, I suppose. But do tell me about one thing before this dive ends: why did you enter the anomaly in the first place?
>
> [AR] A better description for the “anomaly” your people speak of is a tear in the great unseen fabric that surrounds our realm. My sister Noha informed me about odd mutations to the life around Yavhlix, and so I went to investigate. What I discovered was a great cavern surrounding this place. From within, I felt energy beyond any I had received from my father. It was exhilarating, but I felt a deep sense of wrongness, and set about preparing a seal to scab over the tear.
>
> [U1] Why didn’t you ask for help from the other Aspects, or stand on the outside to make your seal?
>
> [AR] Naturally, I tried to create a seal from the outside first. But it was flimsy, and I could tell that without the energy from within, I would not be able to maintain it for long. My responsibility is to be a guardian of this realm. Out here, I feel truly useful. My siblings Maen and Moen are far more capable than I at regulating the affairs of mortals, but no other Aspect will take up this duty of mine.
>
> [U1] I have a new understanding of you, Harbinger. However, time runs short. I must say goodbye for now.
>
> [AR] Farewell, Drehmari.
