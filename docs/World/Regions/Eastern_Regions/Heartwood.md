## In the Lore 

*This forest is a thick collection of hardy trees that grow wildly. These trees are very difficult to maneuver around and have come to encompass a huge region. Most of the area remains unexplored because of the dense canopy and the difficulty of traversal. The people that inhabit this area, the Gozaki, have long struggled with the never ending growth. Eventually they began constructing out of the tree’s strong roots because the stone they used to build became embedded with them. There are two sides to the people of the Heartwood; those that wish to become more intune with the nature around them and embrace it, while others wish to try and develop a method of halting the growth. They primarily serve Virtuo and Drehmal, though the worship of Lahrs, the Aspect of Growth, is also common. The Gozaki are said to hate Maelihs more than all, because of the crimes he has committed against them.*
