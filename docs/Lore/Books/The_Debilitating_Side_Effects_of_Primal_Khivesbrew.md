## Transcription
> It appears that the prolonged presence of pure primal energy within a Drehmari's bloodstream isn't exactly... beneficial. 25 hours after infusion, subjects began complaining of a "searing burning sensation" behind their eyeballs. Common painkillers seemed to ease this symptom temporarily, but would return as soon as the painkillers wore off. 30 hours after infusion, some subjects veins would begin glowing bright yellow. This is when involuntary foaming of the mouth would begin. Antler shedding was observed in some subjects at this point as well. 50 hours post-exposure, subjects' blood began to crystallize. We found that we could re-harvest primal energy from this substance, and in the case of a full blood-drain actually ended up with a net-gain of primal energy compared to the amount included in the initial infusion. After 57 hours, subjects became unrecognizable as Drehmari and mutated into... something else entirely. Extended exposure trials were halted at this point, and all surviving subjects were disposed of. We will continue combat trials of primal khivesbrew, but for safety of all personnel a neutralizing agent *must* be administered 20 hours after exposure at the absolute latest.
