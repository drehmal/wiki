## Nahyn's Trial
Upon reaching the Labyrinth, the following message plays in chat:

> Your back straightens and your pace quickens with confidence buoyed by pride. Though you are small, you have accomplished so much.

This is accompanied by the "Hypogean Labyrinth" advancement.

The player is placed into Adventure Mode, and must find their way through a dark labyrinth to another room, with a sign that reads:

> To Receive My Blessing, Trace Your Path To Enlightenment

??? question "Light Hint"
    The second room is an approximate recreation of the first, which fills in as you walk through the empty spaces. Refer to the sign in the end of the room.

??? warning "Solution"
    There is only one optimal path through the original labyrinth in the first room, and it can be perfectly recreated in the second room. Doing so, as shown in the image below, will complete the trial.

When the puzzle is successfully solved, the player will be given the following message:

> Nahyn congratulates your spotless memory.

A chest will appear beneath the sign at the end, containing the [[Artifacts#Composition No. 9,782,813|Composition No. 9,782,813]] artifact and [[The Facets#Facet III|Facet III]].
