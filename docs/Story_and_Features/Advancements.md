!!! warning "This list contains spoilers for the entirety of the map, including the whole main story, almost all unique items, and nearly every major point of interest."

!!! warning "There are a particularly high number of spoilers for events taking place after the 75% story completion event."

Drehmal contains 217 total advancements, including new sets of original advancements awarded for discovering new areas, acquiring unique items, and progressing through Drehmal's story. There are also vanilla Minecraft advancements present, but some have been removed, and others have been incorporated into Drehmal's original advancement tabs. Vanilla advancements that are still present are affected by the Drehmal resource pack, so the names of mobs and items appear in advancements as they do in Drehmal (for example, Endermen are Primal Walkers).

Advancements are sorted into one of six (6) categories:

- ![Scale](/assets/img/adv/scale.png){ width="24" } **Drehmal:** 48 general and vanilla advancements. <br>
