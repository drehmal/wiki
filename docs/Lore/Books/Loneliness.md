## Transcription
> I'm now the resident of this place. It's sickeningly quiet in here, so different from what I lived back in the city.
>
> I still have an altar at least. Although I'm concerned about its size, and what it worships. With a white this pure, it can not be anything harmful.
> It is very lonely here, I wonder if this is worth it. This is my purpose after all.
>
> My plant is doing amazing since that doctor tested her products on it. It got most of its leaves back. In a deserted place like this, it's good to have company, even from vegetals.
> I am decently sure I heard footsteps roaming around the other night. Maybe it will finally be time to use my trusty sword. I am the lone guardian of this place after all.
>
> The altar is still dazzling. I clean it everyday. It is... mesmerising.
