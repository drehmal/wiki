This book can be found on a lectern, on a floating island in the central portion of [[Rihelma's Domain]]. It is a plea to the Wind Aspect, [[Rihalae]], asking them to return and help foster change in a world the author sees as too stagnant.

## Transcription
> O Zephyr Rihalae, Aspect of Wind, Pure Soul of the Free, hear my prayers! I implore you, guide my hand. The world has fallen into rigid decay, losing its free spirit and is suffering for it. I beg of you, return and let loose the winds of change!
