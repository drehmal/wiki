## Transcription
> Seems like the crew stationed on the eastern side of the Island of Dusk has stopped responding to any of our letters or magic transmissions.
>
> Guess I'll have to gather some guards and go see what happened. If I remember correctly, the mining site is a bit inland? At the base of the mountain. Unsure. We'll figure it out when we get there.
