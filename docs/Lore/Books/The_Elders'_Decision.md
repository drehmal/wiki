## Transcription
> The elders sealed the portal. They deliberated for six days and six nights over the issue. In the end, it was unanimous. Too many Drehmari, not enough homes. We already had to expand beyond the walls. To open again would require an offering of amethyst, but none wish to incur the ire of the elders... it's not like they have much power these days anyways, beyond deciding to close the portal.
