 

This book can be found in an item frame in a house in [[Spearhead Forest#Ruins of Sevick|Sevick]], an island northeast of [[Mossfield]]. It tells the story of a Drehmari about to turn 16 years old as Sevick's plague craze hits, with the author's family quickly devolving to the point of attempting to surgically remove "infected" tissue from themselves, despite the fact there is likely no plague at all.

> I have so many thoughts, I really just need to write them all down. Some stranger washed up on the island a few days ago and now there’s talk of some kind of disease spreading around? I CANNOT get sick from this. My Naming Day is in two weeks, and I will need to speak in front of the whole town!

> Medi told me more about the disease today when I saw her at the market. Apparently this makes you look all swollen everywhere, and you get this big rash where pus bubbles out of your skin. What if I get it? It probably hurts so bad, and everyone will think I’m so disgusting in my Naming Day dress. Oh gods, I hope I don’t get it.

> This morning, Mom said that the disease also makes your bones fragile and they’ll break really easily if you get it. She told me that it attacks the liver and that to cure yourself you have to cut off the infected area. They’ve closed down the market, and everyone is staying inside now. The days are passing so slowly now. Dad is boarding up the windows. I hope we’ll survive.

> I have the plague. I must have gotten it from Medi a couple days ago. I hate her so much. Why couldn’t she have stayed inside?? This morning, I tripped and fell on nothing while walking across the house. One of the first symptoms. Unless we do something now, I'm going to die one day before I turn 16. Dad said he might try to cut out the infected meat on my liver, but I think I’m old enough to handle it. I’ve used the shears plenty of times, and the infected stuff turns green so I should be able to see it clearly. It shouldn’t be too bad. I've given myself piercings before, and it can’t hurt much worse than that. Right??
