## Transcription
> Yesterday, my daughter approached me and asked me why Avsohm is really as great as I say it is. Like many young ladies of her age, she is chafing at the boundaries that society (and especially her parents) have set for her.
>
> It made me stop and think. I had grown so accustomed to reciting “Hail to Avsohm” to anyone I met that I had not thought about the foundations for my patriotism in many long years.
>
> While Emperor Anyr (long may he live) is resplendent and brilliant, and Emperor Ifeihl was noble and well-intentioned, in the end there was only one person responsible for Avsohm’s present age of enlightenment and that was Emperor Drehn.
>
> Not only did he rise to power by winning the peoples' hearts instead of accepting a birthright, he rewarded that trust countless times. His investment into the sciences has improved our standard of living dozens of times over. His code of laws and system of education has safeguarded our bodies and honed our minds. And by always choosing peace before war and prioritizing honesty in all dealings, he created a sturdy foundation for our children's morals.
>
> In no other time in history have Drehmari lived as contentedly as we do today. While some credit goes to the founding peoples of Drehua and the Chosen Kingdom, and the confluence of Blue Exodus, Green Serpent, and Red Dawn, the majority must go to Emperor Drehn Mal'Sohm. Though he died before I was born, I still feel his influence on everything around me.
>
> Rihn is still young. I'm sure she will soon come to see how lucky she is!
