> Once we had dug deep enough, the <br>
mountain’s thi[ck ca]rapace opened to <br>
a massive cav[ern.] Within lied a <br>
twisting, chaotic, writhing mass of raw <br>
reality. It shone violet blackness <br>
th[rou]gh the cavity, casting pitch <br>
black shadow into our handlights. It <br>
was beautiful. The anomaly is not <br>
merely an condensed mass of <br>
energy, it is a tear ripped in the <br>
fabric of time and space itself. And <br>
now we control it. We stabilized it. We <br>
bega[n dr]awing from it. And now we <br>
have [beg]in[^1] to look through it. W[hat] <br>
will we find within the abundan[ce of    ] <br>
the abyss?
