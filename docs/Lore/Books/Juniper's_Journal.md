## Transcription
> It was a long journey and a tall, tall mountain to climb, but we finally made it! Thom's face is all white, but his breathing is steadily evening out. The monks of the monastery are so friendly and accepting! I'm especially fond of Monk Gehru. He helped carry Thom up the long and winding path to Teiruun. I can't help but feel... something when his smile touches the dimple at the corner of his mouth. I could listen to Monk Gehru talk about the Goddess's teachings all day. Ms. Fern told me to seek out her old friend Abbot Balthysar, but I heard from Monk Al'i that he has been away from Teiruun for many weeks. Hopefully he will return soon so I can give him Ms. Fern's letter from Mossfield!
>
> For now, I've been given a nice room on the second floor above the Cleansing Chapel. I've been told that many of the monks left with Abbot Balthysar, so I have one of their rooms to myself.
>
> I noticed some old dusty books under my bed. Maybe I'll need to pay a visit to the library up the main stairs if Thom is still getting his treatment. I am going to sketch out all the wonders I see here in Teiruun to show Ms. Fern when I get home!

> (The next several pages display striking images of the view from Teiruun's bell tower, a handsome monk, a teenaged girl and a young boy smiling in Teiruun's great hall, the design of the Cleansing Chapel from above, and another picture of a handsome monk)
