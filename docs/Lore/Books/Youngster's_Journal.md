### Transcription:
> Grandpa is complaining again. He says us youngsters don't even know how bad we have it, not being able to see Our Lady. Back in his day, Virtuo would do weekly sermons in the Kiln, in that central pool of Hers. But ever since She went missing, the kiln has been almost deserted. Grandpa jokes that maybe She's just hiding out at the bottom of that big pool. Who knows. It's not like the monks would allow us to dive into Her sacred waters anyways.
