# avSYS

![[avSYS.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

AvSYS is an AI that tells the player where to go in the main story and operates the tower teleportation system. AvSYS also manages the material exchange unit in [[The Terminus]].

### Lore

AvSYS was seemingly created by the Blue Exodus (see [[Blue, Red, and Green]]) organization on [[Emperors_of_Avsohm#Emperor Anyr]]'s orders, as part of the Mythbreaker Protocols. It was later reprogrammed by Gohri to send those put into stasis to [[Sal'Mevir]] and the [[Exodus Citadel]] to learn what happened and how to shut down the [[Primary Collection Facility]].

The recoding of avSYS is mentioned in the following books: [[Thresa's Journal]], [[Letter from Gohri]], [[Letter from Thresa]], while we can assume that the creation of the AI is part of the protocols mentioned in [[Av2 1812 - Mythbreaker Protocols]].
