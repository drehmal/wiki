## Transcription
> I was soooooo excited to be assigned to work on a Lo'Dahr facility, now look where I am. Freezing my Serpent-damned butt off doing the same menial labor I did back on Drehmal. Why does this place need to be here anyways? Supervisor said some baloney about fancy ice, but I don't know diddly-squat about it. All I know is that they need to turn the heat up in here! My good friend Masin, bless her heart, is dealing with the same stuff as I am! At least she gets a nice view from that pretty Spaceport.
