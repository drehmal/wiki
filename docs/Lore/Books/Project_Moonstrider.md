>
> Short Term Clinical Trial
>
> Objective:
> To test an anti-aging treatment utilizing bluegrass seeds carved with micro-runes
>
> Participants:
> 50 volunteers ranging from 22 years to 38 years (19 female 31 male)
>
> Control Group:
> 10 volunteers, randomly selected
>
> Method:
> N/A
> Results:
> N/A
>
> Test Group 1:
> 15 volunteers, randomly selected
>
> Method:
> Ingesting 5 carved seeds orally
>
> 5 subjects experienced slightly more energetic behavior and higher blood pressure 5 minutes post ingestion. Effects seemed to wear off at aprox. 2 hours post ingestion.
>
> 7 subjects unaffected
>
> 3 subjects experienced sensations of numbness at aprox. 30 minutes post ingestion to 1 hour post ingestion
>
> Test Group 2:
> 15 volunteers, randomly selected
>
> Method:
> Seeds crushed and injected into the blood stream
>
> Results:
>
> 8 experienced euphoria, dry mouths, and drowsiness for 5 to 6 hours post injection
>
> 5 experienced delusion, drowsiness, and itchiness for 5 to 6 hours post injection
>
> 1 experienced mood enhancement and dry mouth for aprox. 30 minutes post injection
>
> 1 fatality
>
> Test Group 3:
> 10 volunteers, randomly selected

> Method:
> Utilize surgery to insert 5 seeds into the abdominal cavity amongst the small intestine
>
> Results:
>
> 3 experienced infection and the seeds were removed
>
> 5 experienced manic behavior and euphoria along with gradual decrease in blemishes, scars, and lines on the skin.

> Notes:
> I wasn’t sure if I should write this, but I am at my wit’s end. Four months of nothing but lab work, and a willing volunteer dies testing the microseeds. It is absolutely the joy and pleasure of my life to serve you, my Emperor, but I can feel my body falling apart and my memory failing. Don’t get me wrong, I love Avsohm. I was the youngest to earn a doctorate in the history of our empire or the Chosen Kingdom. I worked for Blue Exodus, the DoS, and now Red Dawn on your recommendation. I have met so many amazing friends and colleagues throughout the years. You have even given me an opportunity and funding to pursue my life’s goal with this project! Being taken away from my family and into the labs was the best thing that has ever happened to me for so many reasons. But I am scared. I am so scared. I feel Voynahla’s hand gripping my wrist. If I can’t trust my mind and my memory, what can I trust anymore? I need to go. So therefore, though it may be selfish, please transfer me away for a time. I cannot stand being underground for a moment longer. Although I would love to work with Kovis again, or Vehmil, I absolutely cannot stay at Red Dawn. Please, Your Divine Excellency.
