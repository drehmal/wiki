# Obsolete Transcripts

This section contains dialogue transcripts from major story sequences that have been removed or heavily changed from previous versions. These transcripts are outdated, but they have been kept here for your viewing.

However, none of the information contained in these files should be taken as canon to the current map.

Even though the information is outdated, do be aware of spoilers in this section if you have not beaten the map, as some elements of these transcripts have remained in Drehmal.
