## Location/Summary
This book can be found on a lectern in a small yellow tent, in the northern portion of [[Rihelma's Domain]]. It hints at the location of the Avsohmic [[Resupply Depot]] in the area, at the time of writing.

## Transcription
> This lone platform is so strange. There's no facility attached to it. I've heard tales of an Avsohmic site in the area... perhaps on one of the islands? If so, it must've drifted, as the islands move with the winds. They move clockwise, so... to the west, most likely? I don't have enough resources to continue the search, but this in of itself is a curious find.
