# Verrhys

**Verrhys** (pronounced "vair-hiss") is the Aspect of Silence. The most secretive Aspect, with perhaps the least written information about them, it is unclear if they even persist in the realm of Drehmal.

## In-Game

Verrhys is mentioned by name exactly one time in the entire map. In a set of blackstone and obsidian ruins in the central [[Black Jungle]], a series of labyrinthine passageways leads down to a large cavern beneath the city.

> The Verrhys statue in the Black Jungle.

Inside this cavern is a statue of Verrhys itself, made out of end stone (otherstone) bricks and blackstone bricks. Verrhys is depicted with a form somewhere between a classical dragon and a bat, hiding behind its wings. A sign at the bottom of the pedestal reads: 

> Praise VERRHYS, <br>
> Aspect of Silence

This is the only known appearance of the name "Verrhys" in the map. While in this cavern and near the statue, players are drowned in complete silence, with all other sounds being overridden and the subtitle "Silence deafens".

## Role

Verrhys is seemingly not known to the current inhabitants of the realm, as it is not mentioned in any of the "Theogony" books that describe the other Aspects. Verrhys seems to be a conceptual parallel and foil to [[Lahrs]], the Aspect of Resonance, and similarly encompasses a more abstract domain than the other Aspects. 

Verrhys and Lahrs appear to comprise their own separate "branch" of the Aspects' lineage according to the Aspect family tree mural. It is therefore unclear if Verrhys and Lahrs were created by the [[Primal Tree]], as the rest of the Aspects were. This same mural also seems to imply that Verrhys is the oldest of the Aspects, predating even the Elders.

## Late-Game Appearances

A fragment of what appears to be the wing of one of these Verrhys statues, made of the same materials, is found in [[Mari]]'s room in [[Ytaj]].

One part of the community reconstruction of the [[Codex Celestus]] has been speculated to refer to Verrhys:

> The Aspect of -----, the one I refer to here as our ----- --------, has erased their self from our minds, leaving only silence where memory once thrived. I remember when I was young, ambitious and prideful. Our ----- -------- cared for me and my siblings, and helped us find compromise, though it pained them to see a disc begin to take shape around the roots.

While "silence" does not fit in the initial five-letter gap, the specific reference to silence in this sentence has led some to believe that this refers to Verrhys. From this passage, it might be inferred that Verrhys somehow erased all knowledge of themselves from the minds of the other Aspects, as told by [[Khive]]. This would explain why Verrhys is the only Aspect not mentioned by others, or referenced in the braziers, thrones, and general layout of Ytaj.

Verrhys is also the presumptive subject of [[The Facets#Facet III|Facet III]], a facet which seems to revolve around the concept of silence.
