## Transcription
> Blue Exodus was born out of the city of Stromnar, a proud people with a long warrior tradition. Blue Exodus quickly rose to prominence during the reign of Drehn. Their innovative tactics in battle combined with a highly resourceful usage of Avsohmic technology soon granted them a reputation of sheer invincibility. While most historians note this as ultimately unfounded, it would be wrong to say that reputation was unwarranted. For example, Blue Exodus was behind one of the most high-profile assassinations of all time: operatives snuck into the impenetrable Highfall Castle and murdered Qyhn the Third, the last Virmari King of Highfall. Over the reign of Ifeihl, Blue Exodus was incorporated further and further into the Avsohmic Government, along with her sisters: Red Dawn and Green Serpent. By the coronation of Anyr, they were Avsohm in all but name.
>
> This very closeness spelled the doom of Blue Exodus. With the fall of Avsohm, the entirety of the officer class and R&D division of Blue Exodus disappeared. The ultimate fate of those poor souls is unknown. Similar events across the Empire ensured a complete governmental and societal collapse.
