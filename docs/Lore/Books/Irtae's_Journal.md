## Transcription
> Ah, where has Hanu run off to this time? He said he'd be back before the next festival, but it's been two days. I can only assume he's in Naharja still. He should be fine - arguably the most powerful arcanist on Lo'Dahr - but still, all I can do is worry.
>
> Maybe he's visiting an old friend? Without me? Oh, he wouldn't dare. He'd be sure to have me tag along.
>
> Ah... how I love the man. I miss him so.
