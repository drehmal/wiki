    On Lo'Dahr, these coordinates correspond to the small pyramid structure with this trial.

## Khive's Trial
Upon reaching the Mystic Gallery, the following message plays in chat:

> Nauseating panic drives your eyes wide and quickens your breathing, yet you feel a self-conscious need to show steady control.

This is accompanied by the "Mystic Gallery" advancement.

The structure itself contains only three signs to hint at what to do. They read:

> On this sacred plateau lies a trial of Khive
>
> Let your senses grow and begin to thrive
>
> With an arrow pierce the center of five

The player is then left to solve the puzzle.

??? question "Light Hint"
    This trial is heavily connected to its immediate surroundings. Consider how you may be able to follow the instruction of the third sign using other things in the area.

??? warning "Solution"
    To solve this puzzle, the player must shoot one single arrow, using a bow or crossbow, through the center of five different Khive warp rings. Since these rings are inactive, this means that these five rings must line up as they exist now.
    ??? danger "Instructions"
        About 60 blocks west of the structure, there are five rings along the hillside that all face the same direction, slightly staggered. The fifth is not visible from the starting point, but it does line up. Stand at approximately **(-818, 107, -772)**, facing west-southwest, and fire an arrow through the five rings.

When the puzzle is successfully solved, the player will be given the following message:

> Khive congratulates your impeccable aim. 

A chest will also appear at this point back on the pyramid structure, containing [[The Facets#Facet I|Facet I]] and eight [[Stasis Bolt|Stasis Bolts]], a unique legendary type of arrow.
