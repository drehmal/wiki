> Right behind me is the pinnacle of Avsohmic weapons technology. Well, the **hilt of it**, at least. Currently, the other **pieces** are being kept separate in **secure R&D locations**. Kahmas insisted that they be separate until we can effectively charge it, says it’s too dangerous if someone managed to steal or attempt to use it improperly. We have such good security I don’t think that’s much of a risk, but it’s his project so he calls the shots.
