## Gameplay
The Voidtear Dagger is an NBT-modified iron sword, inheriting that base durability.

Voidtear is a legendary weapon that an entire build can form around, as it makes both stealth attacks and sneaking past hostile mobs a completely viable playstyle. The weapon gives a movement speed boost, and does mediocre damage but has a very fast attack speed, making it best utilized for quick flurries of action.

The weapon's main feature comes from its special ability. Not only does this apply the invisibility effect to its user, it also decreases the distance at which hostile mobs will notice and attack the player while invisible. This makes sneaking through some combat encounters not only possible, but very doable in many locations.

## How to Obtain
Voidtear Dagger is located in the [[Exodus Citadel]], the above-ground, non-story location in [[Nimahj Swamp]] linked to the location of the 50% completion area, the [[Exodus Vault]].

The trapped chest that contains the dagger is found in a side room of the Citadel, in the northwestern corner of the structure. 

**Coordinates:** (-2610, 70, 2295)

## Lore
The Voidtear Dagger that the player finds is one of many, which were utilized by assassins employed by the [[Blue Exodus]] group. Some of these Voidtear Assassins can still be found on the map by the player, as enemies in certain late-game areas. These enemies wield two Voidtear Daggers, and are otherwise completely invisible.
