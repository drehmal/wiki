## Transcription
> Lorahn’s many colors captivate the poets, and much ink has been spilt across the land over Loruhn for its auroras and lazy circles across the horizon. But my eye continues to be pulled toward radiant Lo’Dahr, ancient muse of our order, serenely beaming down from the southern sky.

> The others think I am a fool for my insistence on studying it. I can hear the rustling and muffled snickering from below. Maybe they think I have succumbed to emotion and  am using the scope for a non-academic purpose. Or that I am being regressive by revisiting a topic that is so well-understood. Maybe they wonder if I fancy someone and that I am looking for Moen’s guidance in the golden light. How unbefitting of a Prefect of the Order to believe such gossip-born drivel!

> I care not for what their true thoughts are. I WILL persist. An enormous crater on Lo’Dahr shimmers with a kaleidoscope of color beneath those thick saffron clouds. With two sightings recorded, I need only one more observation to confirm the findings. How I yearn to see the Docents' faces as they are confronted with an empirical proof that the ancient dragons still live.
