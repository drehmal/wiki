**Peace Treaty** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

A spear left from the days of [[Insohm]]'s height, Peace Treaty is a legendary weapon found near the old Insohmic capital of [[Mossfield]]. It is most notable for its defensive playstyle, including the highest level Knockback enchantment in Drehmal.

## Gameplay
Peace Treaty is an NBT-modified iron sword, and has the durability of a vanilla iron sword.

The weapon is very average at first glance, but does have some specific use cases, and can be a strong piece of an early-game build or challenge build. It encourages a somewhat defensive playstyle, with its incredibly high Knockback enchantment enabling players to keep almost all enemies at bay.

In addition, its special ability activates when damage is taken from an enemy, and grants the player Diplomatic Immunity for approximately 6 seconds. This effect is indicated by blue particles, and constitutes a 15% increase in movement speed and +1 armor for the duration of the effect. This ability can re-activate if damage is taken again after it runs out, with no cooldown.

Peace Treaty's Knockback V enchantment can also be used in less orthodox manners. For example, in a multiplayer Drehmal world, a player with Peace Treaty can boost another player through the air at very high speeds.

## How to Obtain
Peace Treaty is found at the [[Insohmic Library|Insohmic Library Tower]] off the eastern coast of the ruins of Old Mossfield. 

Near the top of the tower, the player may notice a chest sitting behind the building. This chest can be reached through a hole in the window on the top floor, or through breaking the bookshelves on the second floor. This trapped chest contains Peace Treaty.

## Lore
Not much is known about this weapon itself, although it heavily references the diplomatic prowess of [[Insohm]], and can be assumed to be a relic of Insohm's time at the forefront of Drehmal's politics.
