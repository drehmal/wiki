## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest atop a hill in southeastern [[Av'Sal]]. Written by a former tutor of Avsohmic founder [[Drehn Mal'Sohm]], it recounts how he was a bright student and a capable leader from his early days, as well as providing insight into the method through which he obtained the title of Emperor.

## Transcription
> Drehn was always a quiet boy in his youth. Both observant and studious in equal measure, he was quick to pick up on maths, history, and science. Even from a young age, he seemed aware of the legacy he held on his back and was determined to make his father proud. The assassination weighed heavily on him, and with the throne of the Chosen Kingdom now empty, he was next in line. But Drehn, to the surprise of everyone, refused the throne, citing corruption and undue influence from the wealthy. This was not to last, as that very move gained him massive popularity amongst the populace. Seeing that the people loved him, and with the Chosen Kingdom on the brink of collapse, Drehn ascended to the throne. With lofty political ambitions, he reformed the Kingdom into the Avsohmic Empire, with the goal of uniting the entire continent. I could not be prouder to have been his tutor.
