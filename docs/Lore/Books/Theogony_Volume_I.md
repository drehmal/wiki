## Transcription
> Introduction
> ***
> In this three-volume series, students of the Fourth Avihm will be transported back into time. Though the age of divinity has now waned, the influence of Deities and Aspects can still be felt everywhere. Let us now venture back to the beginning!
>
> Very little is known about the First Avihm (Av1), but legends speak of a towering tree which dwarved even the mountains, known as the "Primal Tree". In a cataclysm known as the "Felling", the tree toppled over, uprooting the land with it. Though we will spend more time on the draconic Aspects which created the world of Av1, it is important to first discuss the Deities, who were born in Av2. From then until the very end of Av3, these three divine beings have shaped our world in profound ways!
> ***
> Virtuo, Lady of the Mirror
>
> Goddess of peace, purity, and perfection, Virtuo is the most widely-worshipped deity in the realm for good reason. Taking the form of a 12-foot tall Drehmari with shimmering blue horns, she spent most of her time after the Deity War, which ended in Av2 1000, healing the sick and brokering peace between warring nations. Her Ascended peoples, the Virmari, are said to be incredibly beautiful beings of perfect symmetry, though very few remain. At the end of Av3, Virtuo and her all-Virmari Grand Parish suddenly disappeared, ending an era and sending much of the realm into mourning. Still, it seems clear that Virtuo is not dead, for her sacred lanterns still burn, and the remaining Virmari still perform the purifying rites. One day, perhaps, she will return.
> ***
> Maelihs, Lord of the Burnt
>
> God of chaos, conflict, and corruption, Maelihs (or "Mael", as he is sometimes called) is a notoriously angry and warlike deity who takes the form of a huge and armored 15-foot tall Drehmari. The scourge of the West, Maelihs relies on his horde of highly unique but unlearned Ascended, the Maelmari, to fuel an endless crusade to conquer the realm. Though Maelihs has done many terrible things in the pursuit of power, some of his worst atrocities were the unleashing of the Skullbeasts, the Slaughter of Sal'Anyr, and especially, the obliteration of the Southern Heartwood and kingdom of Espinor. Despite, or perhaps because of these acts, his vast armies under the Burnt Generals remain fanatically loyal, and he also retains a modest following of heretical Drehmari worshippers.
> ***
> Drehmal, Realmbinder, Shaper-Serpent, Last Divine, Liege of All
>
> (Also often referred to as the "Final Aspect", this title is highly misleading and will not be utilized in the new edition of these volumes)
>
> Very unlike the other deities, Drehmal takes the form of a gigantic, bearded, green-scaled serpent of nearly indescribable size. Namesake of the realm itself, Drehmal was only active for the several decades at the very beginning of Av2, where they wove the dregs of a destroyed world into cohesive and livable terrain. After this short period of activity, Drehmal has fallen into a deep slumber in the Primal Caverns far below the world. But thanks, primarily, to the writings of the ancient people of Drehua in nearby Palisades Heath, we know about the exploits of a wise, kind, and friendly being who truly cared about the affairs of us Drehmari. Though it is unlikely that they ever will awaken in our lifetimes, we still have their words and actions as example. A small faction of devoted, including many residents of humble New Drabyel, cling to their sage, scrupulous teachings.
