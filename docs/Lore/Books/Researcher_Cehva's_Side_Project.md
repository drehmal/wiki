This book can be found in a chest in the [[Numencore]]. Written by a researcher at the Numencore Facility, it pulls together different anecdotes about the life of [[Orix Cehein]], who has become something of a hero to the author. The book claims that Orix was a masterful arcanist, having previously served as a soldier in the [[Divine Schism]] and worked as a covert operative for the Empire before being assigned to [[Mt. Yavhlix]], where what he saw within the Resonant Eye changed him.

## Transcription
> It is difficult now to believe, but there was a time when Chief Observer Orix was not spending nineteen hours a day at the Resonant Eye, grimly searching and sending queries into the Nothing.
>
> By talking to some of the old salts, I found out that in his younger years, Orix was actually one of the finest arcanists in the Empire. Wielding powerful Kahmas runes which could freeze the blood of an enemy he managed to strike three times, he served with distinction in the Divine Schism alongside Kahmas, now Commander of Blue Exodus. Back in those days, some accounts even suggest that he would occasionally smile.
>
> For years after that, Orix was a covert operative and trusted adviser of both Emperors Ifeihl and Anyr. It is hard to piece together exactly what his function was, but I heard from Chief Science Officer Thresa that he was a security expert, and there were rumors that he once negotiated with Maelihs at the Burnt Palace.
>
> Orix changed when he was assigned to Mt. Yavhlix to run the Eye. Although always a cautious Drehmari, he saw something in the very first dive which chilled him to the core. Technician Vortu said that Orix’s eyes suddenly widened like dinner plates, and he rapidly began barking orders. Vortu's recollection of his words went like this: “Record this data and send it to my archive. I need to analyze this immediately. Do not touch my workstation, and do not turn on the Eye. Go back to Av’Sal, and don’t come back until I send word. GO.”
>
> After the team left, no one was allowed to enter the Yavhlix facility for nine months except a skeleton crew of workers at the Primary Collection Facility and Orix. Unable to work, many of the technicians were confused and very worried. At long last, there was finally holotext explaining that the situation was resolved and that work could continue.
>
> Perhaps it is not my place to pry into his life story, but there is something so admirable and captivating about Orix’s single-minded dedication to his work. He never says much, but I have a feeling that he loves our country just as much as Emperor Drehn did. Perhaps, one of these days, I will work up the courage to talk to him, even though I will probably be disturbing his focus.
