### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the hallway outside of Room B4 on [[The Aphelion]]. It hints at the location of the blast doors on the Aphelion, which must be navigated around in some way while traversing the ship.

### Transcription:
> While prototyping designs for the Aphelion, we found that blast doors were absolutely crucial, more than ever before, to ensure safety and success on our missions. There's four total, all in the back of the station where vacuum exposure is more likely to happen.
>
> I think Thresa would be proud of our dedication to safety!
