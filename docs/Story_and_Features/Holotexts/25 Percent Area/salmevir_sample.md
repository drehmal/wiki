## Transcription:
> We initially thought the amount of energy at the mountain was too miniscule to do anything with… until we sent the drones to perform further analysis. It turned out to be far beyond our wildest dreams, a source of energy so immense that our empire would never want for anything. The construction of the **Primary Energy Collection Facility** may have resulted in the Frostfang Catastrophe and incredibly frigid northern temperatures, but in the end it was the best thing for our empire.
