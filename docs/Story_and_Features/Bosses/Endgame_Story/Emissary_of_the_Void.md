# Emissary of the Void

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "postyav_spoiler.md"

The **Emissary of the Void**, also referred to simply as **The Emissary** or **"The Pawn"**, is the final boss of Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Located at the end of the [[Maddened Path]], Drehmal's penultimate [story location](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/), the Emissary wields the largest set of attacks of any boss in the map. 

The Emissary appears as a [[Drehmari]] wearing a purple hood, and fights with a copy of the mythical scythe [[Oblivion]].

## Location

The Emissary is located at the end of the Maddened Path, atop the large circular blackstone arena at its center. Just before reaching it, in the room below the arena, players are offered a portal back to the Stasis Facility, to gear up and prepare for the battle. If you go through this portal, the return portal at the Court will take you back here.

Exiting out of the portal room, up the rubble path leads to the arena. As a player first approaches, the Emissary will materialize piece-by-piece, snapping together and tossing his scythe in the air, beginning the fight.

## Fight

Like the other bosses of Drehmal, the Emissary's max health varies based on the number of players configured in the `/trigger Settings` menu. He has no armor, and the amount of health shown in the table below includes both phases. Out of this total max health, 30% is allotted to the first phase, while Phase 2 accounts for 70% of the total value.

| **Players** | **Health** |
|:-----------:|:----------:|
| 1 | 2000 |
| 2-3 | 2500 |
| 4-5 | 3000 |
| 6-7 | 3500 |
| 8+ | 4000 |

### Phase 1

> The Phase 1 Emissary of the Void, mid-attack.

In phase 1, the Emissary appears as a purple-hooded figure with light brown antlers, an obscured white face, and a golden pendant around his neck. 

He is immediately capable of a wide range of attacks using his scythe and manipulation of the arena's terrain. While these attacks deal significant damage, they are also well-telegraphed, and can all be dodged. The following is a (presumed complete) list of the Emissary's attacks.

- Wide, heavy swings of Oblivion, which deal heavy damage and leave thick particle trails. Can be dodged by stepping back. <br>
- Spike attacks. The Emissary will hover in the air, summoning a ring of particles in front of himself on the ground. After a couple seconds, he will slam to the ground and evoker fang-style spikes, colored black and purple, will erupt from the ground in this spot, and propagate from this central point in an X-shape. This may be the four cardinal directions (towards the four sides of the center block), or the four ordinal directions (towards the four corners of the center block). <br>
- A dash attack, telegraphed by a line of particles between the Emissary and the player. <br>
- A ground slam attack, which disturbs the terrain around him and can push the player back. Often used as a direct follow-up to the previous move. <br>
- Scythe throws, telegraphed by a pause and wind-up. The scythe will sometimes shoot out shrapnel on contact. <br>

The Emissary is best fought like a Dark Souls boss at this point; sneaking in for short windows to get in a melee attack or two before re-establishing distance.

## Phase 2 { data-search-exclude }

After his health bar has been depleted once, the Emissary falls to a knee and pulls back his hood, revealing a gray face with bright yellow eyes. His health bar refills, and his name is updated to reflect his true identity: **[[Drehn]] Mal'Sohm, The First Emperor**.

Drehn will immediately open Phase 2 with a series of four rapid, alternating dash attacks before running in a circle around the edge of the arena and charging through its center, leaving behind a trail of spikes the entire time. Throughout the entire second phase, it is imperative for players to remain mobile to evade his attacks.

Drehn retains his entire moveset from the first phase, as well as adding a wider range of projectile-based and AoE attacks, listed below.

- Drehn can twirl his scythe and summon forth three orbs reminiscent of the Hole Remnants in the [[Resonant Halls]], which explode into projectiles similar to his phase 1 scythe toss. <br>
- Drehn holds Oblivion to the sky, and the arena is filled with pink rings of particles. Several beams of purple energy bombard these rings from a single point in the sky, and Drehn is free to continue attacking as it bombards the arena for about 15-20 seconds. <br>
- Drehn gains heavier versions of his wide sweeps, with larger shockwaves. <br>
- Evoker fang attacks become more common, and have more intricate criss-cross patterns that span a larger portion of the arena. <br>

At half-health in Phase 2, the bossbar turns red, and Drehn enters his final phase, gaining a new attack. Drehn calls forth a purple eye over his head, which spins in a circle and blasts the surrounding area with a laser beam before exploding. This seems to be his preferred opener for the final stretch, but he can pull it out again.

At very low health, Drehn will summon a permanent ring of spikes, making the arena effectively smaller for his final stand.

When the Emissary's health reaches zero, he falls to both knees, defeated. Oblivion is pulled out of his hands by an unseen force, dangles in the air behind him, and impales him.

He falls face-first to the ground wherever the final blow was dealt, and his soul is visibly seen returning to the Heart of the Void. The Mythoclast will resume speaking, and open one final portal to the [[True End]].

### Multiplayer Mechanics

When the fight is triggered by a player approaching the center of the arena, an invisible barrier forms around the platform, preventing players in the fight from leaving. Players may enter, as they will be teleported into the fight if they approach during an active battle, but if the original player(s) who triggered the fight dies, the encounter will reset.

Players who die in a multiplayer Emissary fight which keeps going will be allowed to rejoin the fight after respawning one time. After two deaths in the same encounter, a player will be locked out from rejoining, forcing the others to finish the job or waiting for the next attempt in the case of failure.

## Lore { data-search-exclude }

The Emissary of the Void is an enigmatic figure who served as the right hand of the [[yellow|Mythoclast]]. He was perhaps better known on Drehmal as a rumor, by another name: The **Pawn of Nothing**, or simply **The Pawn**, as referenced by the [[The Pawn|book of that name]] at the [[Nihilist's Cabin]]. It is revealed in the dialogue immediately following the fight that [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], [[Avsohm]]'s founder and first emperor, willingly took this role upon dying and reaching the [[Court of Nothing]]. Foreseeing the atrocities his empire would go on to commit, he wanted nothing more than to ensure that it would die out, and to see that end. The King of Nothing obliged him, and made him a servant.

Drehn bode his time until he was finally allowed to act during the [[Fall of Avsohm]]. As the [[Oblivion]] description reads:

> The Pawn of Nothing has long acted as a grim guardian, always observing but never acting. On one occasion, this rule was broken. That day, he wielded this weapon as the emissary of Avsohm's destruction and ensured that no leader survived.

Multiple sightings of the Emissary were reported around the day of Avsohm's fall, as reported both by [[Maelihs]] in his dialogue at [[Ytaj]] and multiple books in the map, including [[The Omen]] and [[Bryde's Warning]]. A screenshot of the Emissary captured by surveillance cameras is also visible in a hidden room at the [[Stasis Facility]], heavily implying that he somehow sabotaged the place where our journey began.

It is not clear if the version of [[Oblivion]] that Drehn wields is the "true" version, similar to how the [[Mythbreaker]] has a false version crafted by Avsohm and a "true" version granted to the player by the Mythoclast (although the real Mythbreaker is stated to not truly exist).

Killing Drehn in this fight finally frees his soul from servitude to the Mythoclast, allowing him to be reincarnated well over 1000 years after his initial death.

## Extras

### Trivia

After the Emissary is killed and the end-game sequence is finished, players can re-start it from the [[Court of Nothing]]. In this event, the Emissary's first corpse does not disappear, even during subsequent fights. Therefore, by repeatedly playing through the end-game and defeating this boss, players can theoretically litter the arena with as many Emissary bodies as they wish. The models of these corpses will also update with the active Emissary between phases.

### Soundtrack

The theme for the Emissary boss battle is "At the Edge of Oblivion", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
