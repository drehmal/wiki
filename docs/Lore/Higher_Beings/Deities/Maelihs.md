**Maelihs** (1) (pronounced interchangeably as "mail-iss" or "malice") is one of the three deities born from the Primal Tree upon [[Felling|its collapse]], and is identified as a god representing chaos and destruction. He has been a major figure in the history of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] since the beginning of the Second Avihm, waging nearly constant wars of conquest against the [[Drehmari]] of the realm from his [[Empire of Maelihs|empire]] in the southwest of the continent.

## Description

Maelihs takes the form of a 15-foot tall armored [[Drehmari]] (humanoid) figure with tall, red and white pointed horns. He has a very heavy build, with distinctive burnt red skin and jet black hair. He is often depicted wearing a helmet that covers his face.

He is known to act wrathful and aggressive, constantly in a struggle to conquer to realm. In recent years, however, he has settled into a more peaceful state out of regret for his actions.

## Maelmari

The [[Maelmari]] are Maelihs's ascended version of Drehmari. Maelmari have pale red skin, yellow eyes, and gray bull-like horns. Many Maelmari are used as soldiers and guards for Maelihs's empire, and the more educated ones live in the city of [[Rhaveloth]] at the gateway to the [[Crimson Gorge]].

Maelmari are converted into their forms in rituals at the Sepulchral Altar, some of whom are willing converts and some of whom are captured and forcefully converted.

## Malevolentia

[[Malevolentia]] was Maelihs's signature weapon, a red double-sided trident and sword. Grieving the departure of [[Virtuo]], he discarded it and left it behind at [[Burnt Palace|his palace]], where it can still be found by the player in-game.

## History 

 The details of the First Avihm are unclear, but it is known that Mael was born out of the chaos that ensued from the Felling of the Primal Tree, and that it was, in his own words, not a birth of his own intention. This implies that he unwillingly received divine power from the Primal Tree upon its destruction, and the initial experience was agonizing, as he likely sustained severe burns across his entire body. Mael may have been a mortal living among the [[Maelruhn]] people of the original western continent on the [[disc]], or he may have been created entirely during the Felling. The description of [[Relics#Purifying Light|Virtuo's top-tier relic]] seems to imply that Maelihs and Virtuo have some forgotten, shared history, and that his real name (either the name of the mortal who became Maelihs or Mael's true name) is "Naurduul". This line, spoken from the perspective of Virtuo, reads:

 > "For millennia, I didn't know the many wrongdoings of those who incited my birth. But fragments of memory gave me suspicions, and now, at last, I know the truth. I will do what I can to one day earn Naurduul's forgiveness."

In the early days of the Second Avihm, Maelihs established [[Empire of Maelihs|his own empire]] in the southwestern corner of Drehmal, centered around the Burnt Palace in the Hellcrags. He ascended his [[Drehmari]] worshipers and prisoners to Maelmari, who were used to fuel his war effort against [[Virtuo]] in the [[Deity War]]. The [[First Tharhan Empire]] supported Maelihs with supplies, money and people in order to dissuade an attack. The Deity War ended in Av2 1000 when a deal was struck between Maelihs and Virtuo. Later in the Avihm, Maelihs's conquest of the [West](/World/Regions/Western_Regions/) was prevented by the [[Casain Empire]], the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|Tharhan kingdoms]], the [[Second Tharhan Empire]] and the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]]. Scientists working for Maelihs began to conduct experiments on the powers of the [[Skullmother]], an enormous, flying beast, which was viewed as having potential for military purposes.

After the [[Fall of Avsohm|sudden collapse of Avsohm]], Maelihs seized the opportunity to guide the Skullmother with airships up to the stronghold-city of [[Sal'Anyr]] to the north, obliterating any resistance along the way. The city was completely razed by the Skullmother, leaving few survivors. This marked the beginning of the [[Dune Wars]], wherein the Empire of Maelihs expanded its reach throughout the entire West. During this time, Maelihs was betrayed by [[Klyhf|Klyhf Him'lahk]], a former [[Red Dawn]] [alchemist](Alchemy.md) that defected to his service and befriended the deity. Klyhf Him'lahk, in an attempt to complete the [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]], created a machine and attempted to use it to drain Maelihs's life force to be transferred to himself. Maelihs thwarted the trap, and in an intense fit of rage, he killed Klyhf and destroyed his whole tower in the Burnt Palace. Likely fueled by this bitterness, Maelihs decided to deploy the Skullmother in the [[South Heartwood]] to unleash unmitigated ruin upon the region, in hopes of scaring the Drehmari into subordination.

Amidst the chaos of the [[Tidal War]], a conflict fought to determine the political state of [[Firteid]] after the [[Tide Queen]]'s death, Maelihs stormed the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] and battled Virtuo. He was unable to kill her, but badly injured her, burning her face and taking her eyeball as a trophy. He brought the eye to Rhaveloth and installed it into the shield [[Eyebiter]]. 

The [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] engaged in war with the Empire of Maelihs, seeking to free the lands in the West from his rule and completely eliminate the empire. Initially, they faced setbacks, but after a series of important events, they gained momentum and started pushing back Maelihs's armies. During this time, Maelihs began exploring the remains of Western Xivrhynt, the land from which he originally came. From his travels, he made discoveries and gained a new perspective on his past and Virtuo, realizing that she was not actually at fault for the misdeeds he had blamed her for. He started to regret his jealousy for her, and the great harm it drove him to do. Although the Skullmother could have been used against Insohm to permanently scar their lands, Maelihs had ordered for his [[Burnt Generals]] to hesitate before deploying her. They resolved not to use her, not wanting to anger him. Wishing to no longer inflict destruction, Maelihs eventually set the Skullmother free, to the dismay of the Generals. He remained indifferent as territory was rapidly lost to the Insohmic Coalition. 

After the departure of Virtuo, Maelihs's remorse deepened greatly. As his empire continued to operate under the direction of the Burnt Generals and reconquered most of the West in the wake of the Order of Insohm's dissolution, Maelihs lost interest in the realm, and eventually left the Burnt Palace. 

## Sphere of Influence

![[bp_map.png]]
> A map in the [[Burnt Palace]] of Mael's current territory.

Mael's traditional territory is the [[Hellcrags]] and [[The Carmine]], but over time, he has frequently captured and lost most of Western Drehmal. At the time of the player's journey, Mael's empire additionally holds the regions of [[South Tharxax]], [[Nimahj Swamp]], parts of [[Lorahn'Kahl]], [[Nimahj Swamp]], [[Anyr'Nogur]], [[Mt. Ebonfire]], and the [[Ebony Veldt]].

## Devotion Guide

Mael's [[devotion]] site is the [[Sepulchral Altar]] in the Maelmari city of [[Rhaveloth]].

Several lower-level devotion offerings to Maelihs are found in invisible item frames throughout the Sepulchral Altar structure, but higher-level offerings must be discovered at other statues of Mael throughout his domain in the west.

Maelihs' domain stretches out across the majority of western Drehmal, and statues of the Chaos God can be found with offerings at their bases in several locations throughout the [[Empire of Maelihs|Empire]]. These locations include [[Ebonrun]], [[Tharxax City]], [[Rhaveloth]], and the [[Hellcrags]], with the offering at the base of the Titan of Strength in the Hellcrags being the only hint containing an adored item.

![[mael_chillin.png]]
> Maelihs in-game on his throne in Ytaj

It is discovered via his diaries at the top of the Burnt Palace that Maelihs moved to [[Ytaj]] in Av4 12 to isolate himself from his fanatics and gain proximity to his Aspect relatives. There, the player can find and speak with him, learning that the deity, stricken by guilt, wishes only to be able to right his wrongs by destroying his palace and purging the realm of his evil armies.

Maelihs can be spoken to in his chamber via an in-game dialogue tree, which can be found in full [[Mael_Dialogue.md|here]].

Maelihs is mentioned by [[yellow|???]] in the [[True End|final sequence of the game]].
