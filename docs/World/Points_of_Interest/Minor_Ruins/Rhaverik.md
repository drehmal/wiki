# Rhaverik

![[rhaverik.png]]

**Rhaverik** is a ruined town on the northwest banks of a lake in the [[North Heartwood]]. Its people were wiped out by a mining accident under [[Insohm|Insohmic]] rule, as the Order attempted to mine for [[rehntite]] beneath the surface of the settlement.

Some villagers remain in an inn and trading post just outside the ruins, where a short puzzle leads to a [[Runic Catalyst]].

## Ruins

The ruins of Rhaverik are situated on the northwestern edge of the large lake in the North Heartwood, along the clearing that leads from [[Capital Valley]] to [[Gozak]].

A small house in the south is home to one remaining Drehmari, as well as a chest with the [[Survivor's Account]] book.

To the north, there is a statue of [[Drehmal]], complete with an accepted [[devotion]] offering similar to the others throughout the central regions.

## Inn & Trading Post

To the northwest of the ruins is the Rhaverik Inn & Trading Post, home to an inn building and seven merchants. Each of them only has one trade, which ultimately converts 12 scales into a Runic Catalyst.

    | **Trade** | **Item** | **Lore Text** |
    |:------------------------------------------|:-------:|:-------------------:|
    | 1 - From the "Bee Enthusiast" under the black and yellow tent, purchase a *Sublime Honey* for 12 scales. | Sublime Honey | Honey of the highest quality, taken directly from the gardens of Dusps. |
    | 2 - At the "Birchant" in the birch wood stall, trade your Sublime Honey for an *Ancient Birch Log*. | Ancient Birch Log | A thousand year old birch log, from before the destruction of the Southern Heartwood. |
    | 3 - At the "Missionary of Virtuo" in the blue tent, trade your Ancient Birch Log for an *Ael Irien Dye*. | Ael Irien Dye | An antique dye typically associated with the Goddess of Purity. |
    | 4 - At the "Bow Magnate" in the red and white tent, trade your dye for an *Ultva's Bowstring*. | Ultva's Bowstring | Ultva, one of the founders of the Order of Insohm, was once a master of stealth and assassination. |
    | 5 - At the "Prospector" in the wooden stall, trade your bowstring for a *Burnt Gold Nugget*. | Burnt Gold Nugget | A special nugget of gold, said to originate from Mael's sanctum. |
    | 6 - At the "Pumpkin Mogul" in the red/orange stall, trade your gold nugget for *The Pumpking*. | The Pumpking | Behold, the Pumpking! Greatest of all pumpkins! Blessed with a ghoulish grin and an illuminous aura! |
    | 7 - At the "Runic Machinist" in the green and blue tent, exchange The Pumpking for a [[Runic Catalyst]]. | | |

## Lore

Rhaverik was a prosperous Heartwood town in the Second and Third Avihms, although they were relatively exploitative of the land around them. During the reign of [[Insohm]], the Order discovered a small deposit of impure [[rehntite]] in the mines beneath the town. Pushing the residents to mine it, the over-mining eventually caused a cave-in, draining part of the nearby lake into the mines, collapsing buildings on the surface, killing up to thirty villagers. After that point, most of the townspeople left for other settlements.

## Extras

The "Ael Irien Dye" sold by one of the traders at the Trading Post seems to be an extremely niche reference to a possible alternative/original name for [[Virtuo]], only seen in this item and the [[Relics#Sprout of Anguish|maximum level Sprout of Anguish relic]].

### Merchant Respawn Commands

In the event that one of the custom merchants in Rhaverik is turned into a witch or dies, the following commands can be used (through a command block) in order to respawn them. See [[FAQ#Can Custom Villagers Be Respawned?|this page]] for more information on these commands.
