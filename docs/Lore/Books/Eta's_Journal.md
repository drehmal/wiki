## Transcription
> When we set out on this little adventure, I don't think either one of us expected to reach so far North. Thankfully, we've found what we were looking for. A real Runic Catalyst, right in the palm of my hand! My mentor would be so proud if he could see me now. We're even safe from the harsh blizzard outside, due to the Catalyst making lighting fires a breeze. Never thought that old Laimari trick would come in handy, but here we are. My only concern is some clumps of fur we found on the floor, but they look old. I don't think this cave has been lived in for a very long time.
