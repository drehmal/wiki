It contains the initial negotiation between the Project ArkAngel researchers and the representatives of [[Virtuo]] for the former to utilize the space behind the Kiln for Project ArkAngel, with the [[Virmari]] ultimately accepting in the hopes that learning more about divine magic can help the [[Drehmari]].

## Transcription
> The Goddess of the Turquoise Isle was surprisingly gracious. Although the Serpent is our muse, She welcomed us with open arms. After feasting on a meal of local rice adorned with fragrant herbs and spices and washing it down with cool purified water taken from the springs of the Kiln itself, we spoke with Her Grand Pontiff, Arjuni, about the artifact and our proposal.
>
> Seeing it herself for the first time in the flesh, the Pontiff watched the artifact pulse and shimmer with the latent divine energy radiating from the sanctum. Her silvery blue Virmari eyes became distant. After a moment, she opened her mouth and began to speak.
>
> (The following words are a rough transcription of what Arjuni, Grand Pontiff of Purity, told to Chief Science Officer Eleis of Avsohm that day)
>
> PONTIFF: I am of two minds when I hear your proposal. On one hand, I think your goal is noble. Our realm has grown much too far from the Aspects. While the Goddess is focusing on leading the forces of good against the hosts of Maelmari, she cannot spend as much time helping to maintain the forces of the natural world. Perhaps learning about divine magic really is the path to fulfilling our role as stewards. I must also say that the Goddess approves of your people. Your Emperor Drehn honors Virtuo whenever he chooses to negotiate rather than conquer. His goal of bringing the realm under a single pure, perfect, peace is also laudable.
>
> And yet, young ones, I worry. I worry you are being reckless. In your ambition, you seek to tame a chaotic force of the realm which the venerable Aspects have entrusted only to themselves. Khive has been generous to give us runes, now you seem to seek the whole alphabet. You have seen our blue lanterns, yes?
>
> ELEIS: We've been acquainted, but I do not see the connection to our proposal, Your Guidance.
>
> PONTIFF: It's somewhat analogous to your situation. Those lanterns are lit by orderflame. Regular fire, even the Sacred Flame which heats our world, is chaotic and unpredictable. It is true that they have done great things for our realm and are core to the survival of millions by heating food and bringing light to the night. And yet, the Burnt Lord and his minions use fire to scorch entire towns off the map.
>
> For that reason, our Goddess brought us orderflame. So long as her infinite love persists, our lanterns will neither require fuel nor spread outside their cages. They are not as bright, nor do they produce the same amount of heat. And yet, with Her sacred rites of purification, we require nothing more.
>
> Here is what I will say. You may do as you wish so long as your facility does not disrupt worship activities at the Kiln. Learn about divine magic to better the lives of Drehmari across this land. But do not forget the lesson of orderflame. Do not allow your newfound power to be abused. Even if a Burnt General obtained one of our lanterns, she could not create a bonfire. See to it that your ambition and the applications of any secrets you find are similarly limited.
>
> That is all. Virtuo requests that you wait until after her next Audience Day to move into the cave.
>
> Velmi artrid…
