# Story and Features

!!! warning "The Story & Features section is currently a work in progress. Pages may be incomplete, and several more are yet to be added. Stay tuned!"

The map of Drehmal introduces many new features to the game as well as its own [[Story Progression|storyline]].

## [[Terminus Network]]

Scattered around the map are Terminus towers, white and purple spires from the top of which you can teleport to the Terminus. The Terminus is a hub that allows you to teleport to any tower that you have unlocked previously by finding and using. Unlocking Terminus towers is the primary method through which the story is progressed.

## Holotexts

At major story locations, the player will discover holographic text images, known as [holotexts](/docs/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/). A full list of all 139 holotexts found on Drehmal, organized by location with coordinates, descriptions, images, and alt text transcriptions, can be found in this section of the wiki.

## Special Merchants

Merchants that specialize in selling specific items (usually related to their surroundings) can be found at significant locations throughout the map.

Runic Blacksmiths are present in most settlements, and some other populated structures (or random, solitary locations), indicated by blue striped canvas. They sell [[Artisan Items|artisan items]], which have stat modifiers and lore pertaining to where the blacksmith is.

[Adventuring Merchants[Adventuring Merchsnt]] are present at all official towns on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], indicated by striped red and orange canvas. They sell a map of the town's region (showing some nearby landmarks), a map of Drehmal showing the locations of all official towns on the mainland continent, bundles and an additional item that differs with each merchant.

## [[Special Items]]

Many custom items can be found around the map, and these items have different classes; trinket, artifact, artisan, relic, legendary and mythical. Special items each have their own descriptions and usually stat modifiers, and some classes of items have unique sprites/models.

## [[Devotion]]

Devotion is a mechanic that allows players to give offerings to certain Aspects and Deities, in the form of specific items that appease them. Offers are given at devotion altars dedicated to the recipient. The more items offered, the more the player's devotion to that aspect/deity increases, and as it increases they will be gifted rewards, including [[Relics]] (offhand stat-modifying items).

## [[Soundtrack]]

Drehmal boasts a custom OST created by Chris Nesja and Penngo, with tracks corresponding to individual towns and areas, as well as general exploration music. Every official town on the map has its own theme song. There are also leitmotifs for certain entities that are present throughout multiple tracks. Many tracks can be listened to at any time in-game with the item [[AvPod]], as long as the player has heard them at some point before.
