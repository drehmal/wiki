**The Disc** is the planetary body on which Drehmal is located, in addition to the (lore-only) continents of Western and Eastern [[Xivrhynt]]. 

The disc does not have a proper name, although it could plausibly just be called "Drehmal" along with the mainland and the realm at large. 

It is named as such because, unlike Earth, it is not a globe. Rather, it is a flat disc (or upside-down cone), with all of the habitable land being atop the flat surface of the planet. 

## Lore

The disc is believed to have formed around the base and roots of the [[Primal Tree]] at the dawn of the realm, and has since been dominated by [[Drehmari]] civilization. Its was formed in part by the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), and its land was initially split into three continents: [[Primzahl]] in the center, home of the Tree, and two continents in the west and east whose names are not known. The [[Maelruhn]] and [[Viruhn]] likely came to settle these two continents, respectively, and their conflict caused the destruction of the land.

The land was then reimagined and rebuilt by [[Drehmal]] in the early Second Avihm, and since then, it has hosted the same three continents. [[Overworld|Drehmal]] is the only one of these confirmed to have any remaining civilization, and is where functionally all of known history has taken place. The continents of Western and Eastern [[Xivrhynt]] are also supposedly on the disc, but not present in-game. 

Lore also hints at the existence of another race of sapient beings who live in the deep caves underground in the disc, possibly even hanging from the underside. This is the realm of [[Neverdawn]], strange arachnid people who are found in [[Caer Adacia]] and referenced in another deep cave. This expansive underground is also not a part of the current map.

## Extras

A more detailed view of the disc can be seen in the late-game, beyond the 75% story event.
