1. Official subtitle not yet revealed.

An update to follow the colossal [[Drehmal v22|Apotheosis update]] has long been considered, but was not immediately started on after the release of 2.2 due to developer time conflicts. It was formally announced in a [blog post on the five-year anniversary of Drehmal v2](https://www.drehmal.net/post/five-years-of-drehmal), following the addition of multiple new members to the dev team.

At the end of 2025, an [additional blog post](https://www.drehmal.net/post/about-drehmal-2-3-and-beyond) was made to further expand upon the update's content.

## Known Content

The exact content of the 2.3 update is, as per usual, closely guarded by the dev team. However, the ["About Drehmal 2.3 and Beyond" blog post](https://www.drehmal.net/post/about-drehmal-2-3-and-beyond) lays out a rough idea of the update's scope.

This post shows reworks to multiple towns ([[Gozak]], [[Ebonrun]], and an unidentified town) and biomes, including [[Capital Valley]], the [[North Heartwood|Heartwood]], the [[Black Jungle]], and [[Spearhead Forest]]. An in-progress overhaul to the [[Devotion]] mechanic is also alluded to.

The post also teases something separate from these mentioned reworks, however, referred to as "something weird, different, and ... kinda insane." Lead developer Keeko100 describes it as:

> - Intended for players who have beaten the map and reached the final credits <br>
> - Intended for highly skilled, motivated, and passionate players <br>
> - Intended to be played in a group, though still possible solo

## Teasers

2.3 teasers have been posted monthly in the official Drehmal Discord server since July 2025. These typically take the form of an image from development with a cryptic, but pertinent caption, although sometimes the teasers are less conventional.

### July 2025

The first teaser was of a not-before-seen town, posted on July 15, 2025. Notably, this image shows resin blocks, which are only present on 1.21+ versions of Minecraft.

> The facsimile of a city of water, soon lost. A treasured memento of a free people doomed to die by the uncaring heart of fate.

### August 2025

Posted on August 12, 2025, the next teaser image shows a yellow-green birch forest.

![[teaser_aug_25.png]]
> In regions untouched by the wars waged between empires, the Realmbinder's vision remains intact.

### September 2025

On September 12, 2025, an image was posted of a dark, foreboding hallway, lit in green. Its message is strange and appears partially corrupted.

![[teaser_sep_25.png]]
> Look upon my wo-///-n AWE <br>
> Feel ou-//-ing legacy and WEEP <br>
> Stand by my co-/////-nd and march ET//NAL <br>
> Sh-////- be slain by Rengia's spea-/ <br>
> //- my VESSEL

### October 2025

On October 12 of 2025, rather than a standard teaser image, the Drehmal Discord's announcements channel was graced by a [[Librarian|mysterious visitor]], who provided the server with the [[Archived Memory]] playable teaser.

### November 2025

The next teaser came on November 12, 2025, showing an updated Mt. Scarstone and its surrounding terrain in the [[North Heartwood]]. It also introduced a new group, the Mokhan, who are not mentioned in 2.2.

![[teaser_nov_25.png]]
> The diverse Mokhan peoples of the East all trace their lineage to the holy mountain widely known as Mt. Scarstone. Ancient carvings in the hollow beneath suggest a royal relation to the entombed.

### December 2025

The next teaser was shown on December 25, 2025. It features a stone orb sitting on a pedestal in a dark room, surrounded by massive bookshelves.

![[teaser_dec_25.png]]
> The provenance of the orb is unknown, and curious emblems cover the surface. They lack the ordering defining Khivian runes. Nyctoscopic shamans across the continent claim to have seen it in their dreams long before it fell from the sky.

### January 2026

The most recent teaser was on January 23, 2026. It depicts the heights of a cathedral's belltower, tall enough to where the clouds obscure the ground. This was later revealed to be part of a rework of [[Fort Nimahj]].

![[teaser_jan_26.png]]
> The fledgling empire of Avsohm sprung from the stock of many Great Houses, loosely united under Drehn's central banner. Just as they grew with their empire, they would die alongside it. All but one, that is.
