## Transcription
> I've received reports of pillagers from the Verdant Labyrinth moving into the old ruined castle on the black mountain northeast of here. Apparently it's quite the formidable force. We'll have to assemble a squad of guards to take them out or persuade them to leave.
>
> I wonder why they've moved here. The group in the Labyrinth is practically a small army - they have a stranglehold on the area and plenty of resources. They're an extremely formidable force, but I don't see why they would expand to that old abandoned castle? Maybe they're looking for something. I've head rumors about that mountain hiding something within it, but they're just that - rumors.
