## Transcription
> We are the Sunchasers, the most highly esteemed branch of Lord Maelihs' scientific division. Our glorious task is to chart the path of the Torahn across the sky, in order to divine its secrets and determine its true nature. And finally, we have succeeded.
>
> We are the Sunchasers, the most highly esteemed branch of Lord Maelihs' scientific division... at least, we used to be, until we actually accomplished our goal. After years of intense study, it turns out that the Torahn is nothing more than a... fish.
>
> Yes, a fish.

> It takes the form of a large pufferfish, inflating with gas during the day, and deflating during the night. Maelihs was distinctly unhappy that this very expensive project produced such... mundane results. We were completely unable to divine anything from the path of the Torahn, as unlike the other four spheres of Drehmal, it appears to behave in an entirely deterministic manner, unbeholden to the rest of existence. In a sense, it is the timepiece upon which the universe aligns itself, but to draw alchemical energy from it is difficult.
