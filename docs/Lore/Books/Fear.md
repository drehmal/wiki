### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the Alchemist Coven building in [[Maen's Domain]]. It discusses fear, the third primal emotion, and its uses in alchemy.

### Transcription:
> Fear is the third and final Primal Emotion. Beings feel fear when faced with danger or otherwise threatened. There are many reactions to fear, such as paralysis, attempts to fight back, or attempts to flee. Of course, all three reactions are futile when gagged and bound, as many of our subjects are. Fear, like all three emotions, is a useful catalyst in Alchemical rituals. With the power of Fear, we have created a new tool for the Talon to assist in keeping the mortal vermin in check. This serum can be administered at range and will put the subject into shock, able only to speak the truth when interrogated. The lingering psychological effects on the subjects are not ideal, but such a powerful tool is worth the consequences.
