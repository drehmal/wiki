## Transcription
> Pleasure is, in many ways, a counterpart of Pain. It is a slightly more well-formed emotion, requiring positive stimuli. Food, music, and love can all induce Pleasure. Pleasure can also be "artificially" induced via drugs. Pleasure is useful in the Primal Energy refinement process. While there are many ways to turn Primal Energy into usable forms, the easiest all involve Pleasure rituals. Once this refinement is done, we are able to use Primal Energy as we would any other Alchemical catalyst, albeit one more powerful than any other known reagent.
