# The Hunting Party Crypt

![[Origin1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }
The Hunting Party Crypt is the burial place of members of the Party, most notably Asrihk Clearbrook, Ehri Gahra and Gahwyn "The Serendipitous". Shrouded in shadows and filled with monsters, it takes the form of a series of corridors, with murals depicting gods and various historical events.
Its entrance is located in the North of the [[Capital Valley]] [region](/Regions), below a cliff.


### Trivia

This place is an homage to the previous spawning point of the player (in 2.1 and before), being a perfect replica of it ant containing the "class boots" that were given to the player along with his class.
