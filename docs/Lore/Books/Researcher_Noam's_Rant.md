## Transcription
> Blue Exodus showed up on our doorstep today asking for us to take care of this fragment of Primal Energy. Serpent only knows what it's for.
>
> Apparently, it's part of a deal brokered by Chief Science Officer Thresa and General Kahmas for us to store some important artifact. I don't know why Blue Exodus can't handle their own blasted toys! They have more than ten times the budget that the DoS, and Sal'Mevir only has a fraction of THAT. Everything is going to slow down for us if we need to spend half of our power budget on stasis containment for some weapon that we can't even study. Just goes to show that Avsohm cares way more about military might than anything that might actually help people.
