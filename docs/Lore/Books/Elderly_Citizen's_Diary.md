> I reckon I maybe shouldn’t be writing about this, but Lil Tuhli and her soon-to-be sibling will be old enough someday to take some pride in their old grandma’s actions in service of the Empire!
>
> You see, I was a welder working on the left flank of the greatest vessel Avsohm has ever commissioned, the Aphelion! If you can believe it, I worked there for five years and didn’t stay to see the project finished. Had a bit of a dispute with the shift manager over the treatment of my good friend and coworker, and we were shipped out of there lickety split!
>
> Course, they never really needed us. Hundreds of folks were working on our side of the bow alone, and plenty of them were willing to keep laboring despite the lack of lunch breaks for those unlucky enough to run afoul of the leadership. I was happy to leave the mountains of metal and that infernal clanging behind once and for good.
>
> The bakery suited me better. The work was hard, but at least I met Grandpa, and we raised a lovely family. And unlike with welding, I got to see smiling faces every day. But there is a part of me that would still love to see that vessel sailing the seas or casting a huge shadow on the ground beneath as it cruised overhead. It really was a thing of beauty even back then, the Aphelion. I’m sure it is even more magnificent now!
