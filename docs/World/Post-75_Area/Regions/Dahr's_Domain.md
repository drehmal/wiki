**Dahr's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the Elder Sea Aspect and king of the entire moon, [[Dahr]]. As one might expect, the region is primarily made up of water, including a swamp sub-region, a large river, and a series of waterfalls into the moon's largest lake. This domain is found in the southern and southwestern portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, forming a buffer between [[Loe's Domain]] in the far southwest and the rest of the moon. 

## Geography

Dahr's Domain takes on an inverted-L shape, consisting of a large lake in the region's center, swampland stretching out west, and a large river reaching to the south. It generally has a lower altitude than its neighboring regions, with its main lake lying at y=15 and hilly terrain around all edges of the region. The majority of the region's land lies between y=15 and y=70.

The region has one long border with [[Loe's Domain]] to its southwest, and borders six other regions to its north and east. The swamp's water is fed by the large river that runs through the center of [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the north, and the main lake in the south is fed by springs that form a series of cascading waterfalls.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:** <br>
- Large swamp in the western portion of the region, covered in blue trees. <br>
- Hilly, forested area along the northern border with Vayniklah's Domain. <br>
- Massive lake and surrounding grasslands in the central and southern portion of the region.

Trees throughout the region primarily have aventurine hyphae (warped stem) wood, although the leaves differ: in the western swamp, the leaves are a deep, cobalt blue achieved by giving jungle leaves a custom texture, while the land surrounding the large southern lake has "leaves" of aventurine pileus blocks, or warped wart blocks, which are opaque and have a lighter blue color. The hilly area in the northwest uses both types of trees.

A bridge stretches over the swamp region in the west, connecting [[Khive's Domain]] in the north and [[Loe's Domain]] in the south.

A single [[Drehmari]] settlement, [[Riverstead Town]], is found in Dahr's Domain, in the forested area near the northern border.

### Biome Details

Dahr's Domain is entirely made up of the **Eroded Badlands** biome.

Grass, dirt, and warped (aventurine) nylium take on an unsaturated, gray-brown color when placed in this biome, making the dirt blend well with gravel found in the region.

In Dahr's Domain, water takes on a light blue color, and the skybox has a similar light blue gradient.

## Gameplay

Dahr's Domain is home to **Sandhoppers**, custom spider mobs. These spiders have green eyes, are functionally immune to fall damage, and are aggressive during the day as well as at night. They also have 24 health compared to the 16 health of a vanilla spider, and deal 4 base damage as opposed to 2 base damage from vanilla spiders.

In the large lake, guardians (**"Dahrkin"**) can also be found. These are simply renamed vanilla Guardians.

A massive sea serpent can also be seen wandering the large lake, and this serpent, [[Vehrniis|The Vehrniis]], can be fought in an arena accessed from the lake's western shore. After it is defeated, it will return to patrolling the lake, now with a trident stuck in its head.

## History

The entire moon of Lo'Dahr was once the domain of Dahr, as referenced by the lore text of [[Relics#Writ of Authority|his fully-leveled relic]]. Technically, the entirety of the moon is still his domain, although he allowed the other [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) to carve their own domains into the moon at some point, likely in the later First Avihm or early Second Avihm. Today, Dahr's Domain is the only portion that remains directly under the control of the Sea King alone.

At some point, Dahr challenged the inhabitants of the moon to defeat a great beast in a sea cave within his domain, promising a "trident of great power" to any who could pass this challenge. None have succeeded, although their [[Artifacts#Lesser Scalepiercer|homemade tridents]] littering the landscape show that many have tried.

There have been notable [[Tehrmari]] settlements in Dahr's Domain, most notably the town of [[Arkeje]] on the southeastern border with [[Voynahla's Domain]]. This settlement appears to have been the center of a larger political entity, the [[Republic of Arkeje]], which was a strong force in Ro'Tehrmari politics. Arkeje also appears to have taken significant influence from [[Voynahla]], shown by [[Will of Kanama|one book]] written by a Ro'Tehrmari citizen of Arkeje who has chosen to commit suicide in honor of the Aspect of Death, and to escape their oppressed status as a Ro'Tehrmari. Arkeje fell at some point before the player arrives on Lo'Dahr, and is abandoned in-game.

Other parts of the region also have minor settlements. [[Riverstead Town]] is found in the northwest, near the border with [[Vayniklah's Domain]], and is populated by [[Drehmari]], unlike the majority of the moon's Tehrmari population. These Drehmari are likely the former residents of [[Helmshire]] who fled following a series of disappearances, entering through the [[Spearhead Forest]] portal, emerging from the portal in Vayniklah's Domain, and following the river south to their current location.

The swamp sub-region is inhabited primarily by outlaws, such as the enemies found in Kronglam's Fort, although [[Scion's Diary|another book]] describes a prominent figure passing through this area: a powerful pyromancer, who taught the author of the book, a noble from [[Lai's Domain]], how to wield her unique flame.

### Abyssal Rise

[[Abyssal Rise]] is a massive structure found in the far southern lake of Dahr's Domain, and is the site of Dahr's [Trial](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/).

### Arkeje

The abandoned village of [[Arkeje]] can be found in the far southeast of the region, on a hill overlooking [[Voynahla's Domain]] to the east. While this location appears to be of historical significance, particularly to the Ro'Tehrmari, all that remains in the village today are two books: [[The Augury]] and [[Will of Kanama]].

### Riverstead Town

[[Riverstead Town]] is the only non-hostile settlement in Dahr's Domain which is inhabited in-game, seemingly established by Drehmari from [[Helmshire]] in the [[Spearhead Forest]] region. It is home to a [[Runic Blacksmith]].
