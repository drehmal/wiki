## Gameplay
Whispersong is an NBT-modified bow.

The bow has significant stat penalties, taking away 60% of the player's max health and movement speed, encouraging a relatively stationary, sniper-style fighting style. This couples well with the fact that the bow makes the user invisible, and is enchanted with Power VII, two levels higher than the vanilla Power limit. This effectively means that a fully charged Whispersong shot can deal upwards of 9 full hearts of damage to an unarmored enemy. 

Whispersong's special ability is a passive ability, which simply gives an indefinite invisibility effect to the player while it is held in their main hand.

## How to Obtain
The Whispersong is located on the [[ICS Arbiter]], a floating airship just off the northeastern coast of [[Merijool]].

Within the Arbiter, Whispersong is found inside a trapped chest at the bow of the ship, in a room behind an iron door.

## Lore
Whispersong is a model of bow that was carried by elite [[Insohm|Insohmic]] guards known as the Whispers. This bow's ability to make them invisible, combined with its incredible power, made the Whispers very proficient bodyguards.
