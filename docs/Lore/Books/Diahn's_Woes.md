Found in a house divided down the middle, with one red half growing plants on carnelian nylium and the other blue half growing plants on aventurine nylium, the book tells how this came to be, with the author and her husband disagreeing on which to cultivate and decorate with.

## Transcription
> My husband just has no taste! Our lives were nothing but marital bliss for the better part of a decade, but then Orae came to visit from her little village in Tehrmia.
>
> Well, needless to say, things have changed from the worse since then. I blame my fat mouth! One look at those enchanting cyan fungi, grasses, and vines that Orae had along with her, and I knew we needed some for our garden.
>
> I didn't think much at the time about my husband choosing some rather garish red roots and fungi for himself out of her wares, but I should have thought a little harder before agreeing to it.
>
> Those little mushrooms and roots are ghastly! They gulp down water like they're dying of thirst, and threaten to choke out my perfect little angels. Of course, Horus doesn't see things my way. We fought so hard about our exotic plants that we needed to make a compromise.
>
> That's how our home came to the sorry state it is today. First, the red and cyan plants were separated. Then, our beds drifted apart. Now, seemingly just to spite me, he's gone and purchased a red comforter and fitted sheet. Naturally, I went and found some of a pleasant cyan shade.
>
> I don't know that things will ever be the same between Horus and I. Maybe we'll need to have Orae over again. I'm sure that as a Tehrmari'la, she's dealt with these kinds of issues before.
>
> Horus, if you are reading this, you're dead!
