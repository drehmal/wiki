**Hovadchear's Greathammer** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Located in [[Spearhead Forest]], Hovadchear's Greathammer is a legendary weapon once wielded by [[Hovadchear|Master Hovadchear]] of [[Insohm]] himself. It is an incredibly powerful heavy weapon, with the ability to completely shatter enemy armor and weaken enemies.

| **Lore**                      | Hovadchear Myrik, one of the founders of the Order of Insohm, was a master architect. Towards the end of his life he valued transparency above all else, which did not coincide with the Insohmic Council's motives. |

## Gameplay
Hovadchear's Greathammer is an NBT-modified diamond pickaxe, retaining the durability and ability to break blocks that a vanilla diamond pickaxe does.

The Greathammer's primary use, however, is as a weapon. It is among the strongest legendary weapons in the game, lending itself towards a heavy tank-style build with its movement speed penalty, very high max health boost, complete immunity to knockback, and very strong, but slow attack.

The Greathammer's special ability, Unrelenting Shatter, activates on a fully charged critical attack (while falling downwards). When successful, it will flash an image of a broken shield on the screen, indicating that the hit enemy's armor has become ineffective, and that the ability is active. This is extremely powerful against custom armored enemies later in the game.

## How to Obtain
Hovadchear's Greathammer is found at its namesake, Castle Hovadchear—or what remains of it—in southwest [[Spearhead Forest]].

The legendary weapon is found in the only building left at the crater where the castle once stood, guarded by an Evoker, inside of the tomb dedicated to Hovadchear Myrik.

## Lore
Hovadchear's Greathammer once belonged to, as its name would suggest, [[Hovadchear|Hovadchear Myrik]], one of the co-founders of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. The item's description, which mentions Hovadchear's skill as a master architect, suggests that he may have used it for construction, rather than exclusively for combat.

## Extras

### Changes

In version 2.2.2, the Greathammer's armor shred was reduced to 30%. It is not clear what it was before.
