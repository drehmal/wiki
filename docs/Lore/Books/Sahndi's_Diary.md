> Dear Diary,
>
> I think I just overheard something HUGE. Something that I, a mere janitor, should never know. Momma always said that it isn’t polite to snoop into other people’s business, so I wouldn’t dare bring this home. But this thing is eating me alive, so I'm bringing it to your pages. Suppose that’s what a diary is for.
>
> Alright, here goes. I was dusting off the old stasis pod prototypes when I heard a crowd of excited voices speaking quickly and quietly to one another. I could tell immediately that one belonged to Senior Researcher Vehmil, and, straining my ears, I was shocked to hear the precise and confident tones of the Chief Science Officer herself!
>
> What happened next, I can’t explain. Maybe it was curiosity, or maybe it was embarrassment, but for some reason, rather than leaving the room, I ducked into the stasis pod I was cleaning and stayed there, stock still, for the next two hours.
>
> At first, I could barely hear over the thumping of my heart and the shame washing over my mind. In time, though, I decided that there were eight participants in the meeting. Their voices were very quiet, so it was still hard to make out what they were talking about.
>
> As I strained my ears, I started to be able to make sense of some words that were spoken repeatedly. "Mt. Yavhlix" was mentioned often, and so were “contingencies” and something like “Apart the Ohsis Project”.
>
> Part of me wishes that I had cracked open the heavy pod door to get a better listen, but Momma raised me right. Instead, I've been asking around the labs about Mt. Yavhlix. Folks around here have always been willing to gab, and it seems like that place is really special to them. I’ve learned that it’s over to the northeast of the continent, that it’s where the Empire’s primary energy source is, and that some really fascinating research is happening inside the big facility up there.
>
> But it doesn’t feel like they’re telling me everything. Maybe it has to do with that odd shipment we got a couple weeks back. Or why stasis pods keep getting built here and sent out under cover of darkness. I can't rightly say, but I'm getting more and more obsessed every day. Maybe I’ll get to the bottom of it all.
>
> Or maybe I shouldn’t. Hm. It does seem way above my pay grade. Shut up and sweep might be the better plan. I’ve gotta think about it.
