# Drehmal Lore Timeline

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

!!! warning "The following timeline contains significant spoilers through the end-game of Drehmal v2.2, as discovering parts of the world's history is a central driving force for the main story. Particularly towards the end of Av2, some details are intentionally omitted for spoiler reasons, mostly pertaining to information found at the very end of the story."
    We recommend not diving too deep into this timeline until you have reached the map's end-game, although nothing on this page should necessarily spoil major story events. Late and end-game concepts will be linked to and spoken about somewhat openly, but the events themselves will not be gone into in detail. 
    
    If you are spoiler-sensitive, you should not read this timeline until you have at least reached the "Apotheosis" advancement following the 75% story event.

Dates in Drehmal's calendar system are written with the era first, followed by the year: `Av2 1750` would refer to the 1,750th year of the Second Avihm. Months and days are also sometimes referenced, but these are less frequent and not always consistent in their formatting.

`c.`, or `circa`, indicates a best estimate for an event which does not have a clear canon date. These are generally not supported by specific evidence in the map, but rather, constructed based on the little we do know.

Not many specific dates are given in the map, so a large amount of this timeline is made up of approximate dates. The general sequence of major events is relatively well-understood, but the exact year that most events occurred is either not public knowledge or has not been fully established within the canon.

## Overview

The history of the realm known as Drehmal is divided into four eras, each known as an “Avihm.” Each avihm is not a set amount of time, but rather, the end of an avihm is typically marked by an extremely significant, world-changing event. 

The First Avihm (Av1) is mostly lost to time, but is known to contain the beginning of civilization after the realm was created by the [[Primal Tree]] and [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), and ended with the destruction of the Primal Tree and subsequent creation of the three [deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/). 

The Second Avihm (Av2) is marked by the meteoric rise of [[Drehmari]] civilization throughout the continent, and in particular, the dominance of the highly advanced [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] in its later centuries. Av2 spanned nearly 2000 years, and ended with the [[Fall of Avsohm|mysterious collapse of the Avsohmic empire]]. 

The Third Avihm (Av3) lasted approximately 900 years, and was defined by conflicts between the remaining political entities, primarily the Order of [[Insohm]] in the East and the forces of [[Maelihs]] in the West. It ended with the departure of the goddess [[Virtuo]] and dissolution of Insohm. 

The Fourth Avihm (Av4) is the current era, with little centralized power or advanced civilization to be found in the now-fragmented realm. A playthrough of Drehmal begins with the player’s awakening at the Stasis Facility, approximately 100 years into the Av4.

## The First Avihm (Av1)

Practically nothing is known about the dawn of the realm besides the basic creation myth, which asserts that the [[Primal Tree]] was the first being in Drehmal. It is said that reality itself formed around the base of the tree, with the disc taking shape around the tree's roots. Due to the mystery surrounding the First Avihm, it is unclear if the physical creation of the world itself would be considered part of Av1, or pre-historical entirely. For this timeline's purposes, Av1 is considered to span from the creation of the realm to the [[Felling]].

No concrete dates are known for the events in Av1, but the rough sequence is mostly clear.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c. Av1 0  | Creation: The [[disc]] first forms around the [[Primal Tree]], and the Tree creates the first [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) to assist it in the creation of the world. The four Elder Aspects are the first known creations of the Tree, as [[Taihgel]] creates the world's land, [[Rihelma]] forms the skies, [[Dahr]] creates the world's oceans, and [[Khive]] manages its magic. The Aspect of Silence, [[Verrhys]], also appears to have been alive at this time, but its actions are not known. |
| ??? | Over the course of the Avihm, the rest of the Aspects are created both by the Tree and by the other Aspects. The Tree creates the Major Aspects [[Vayniklah]], [[Voynahla]], [[Lai]], and [[Loe]] very early into the realm's history, and the rest of the Minor Aspects are, for the most part, children of the Major Aspects. |
| ??? | The Primal Tree creates the first [[Drehmari]], who go on to populate the world it has created. This world consists of three similarly sized continents, the central continent being [[Primzahl]], where the Tree stands. |
| ??? | Over the course of several decades, the Drehmari form civilizations, and eventually spread out to the other two continents. Those in the west are known as the [[Maelruhn]], and the easterners come to be known as the [[Viruhn]]. |
| ??? | Mystic Elder [[Khive]], wishing to allow the mortals to utilize some of the [magic](/Lore/Magic/) of the realm, creates runic magic and personally teaches it to the Drehmari. |
| ??? | Drehmari civilizations flourish under the teachings of the Aspects. The city of Ihted in particular is home to a massive wealth of mystic knowledge, centered around its [[Ihted Academy|academy]]. |
| ??? | [[Aok]], a former friend (and likely student) of Khive, completes the [[Great Work]] through the creation of [[necromancy]]. |
| ??? (Final Year) | Tensions between the Maelruhn and Viruhn culminate in a massive battle at the base of the Primal Tree, likely called the Battle of Karesh. The violent conflict burns and topples the tree, in a world-shaping cataclysm known as the [[Felling]]. The uprooting of the tree functionally destroys or renders uninhabitable the vast majority of the land on the disc, and very few people or civilizations survive. <br>The Tree's soul splits into the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/): [[Maelihs]], [[Virtuo]], and [[Drehmal]]. |

## The Second Avihm (Av2)

The dawn of the Second Avihm is brought about by the [[Felling]], resulting in the destruction of the land and birth of three new Deities. The Aspects are much less directly involved in the history of the world beginning in Av2, mostly residing on the divine moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]] instead. 

Rebuilding the world and Drehmari civilization from a clean slate, Drehmal spends several decades at the beginning of Av2 physically re-forming the world, earning the title of "Realmbinder". A massive conflict between forces of [[Maelihs]] and [[Virtuo]], named the [[Deity War]], takes up nearly the entire first millennium of the Avihm. The second half of the era is defined by the rise of advanced Drehmari civilization across the new continent, culminating in the unparalleled dominance of [[Avsohm|The Empire of Avsohm]] in the final two to three centuries. The Avihm ends in Av2 1820, with the sudden and bizarre collapse of the empire.

### Early Av2 (Reformation and Deity War)

Little is known about the specific events of early Av2, as this time was ancient even to Avsohm. It is marked primarily by the re-formation of the land by Drehmal and the re-establishment of a few civilizations throughout the realm, followed by the centuries-long Deity War.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c. Av2 1-50    | Drehmal begins the long process of re-forming the land. Pulling together bits and pieces of the outer continents, the land comes to take the form of one massive continent in the center, with two irreversibly damaged continents known collectively as "Xivrhynt" at the far western and eastern edges of the disc. |
| c. Av2 5-20 | Some of the first lands to be repaired and made habitable by Drehmal are once again settled by small groups of Drehmari survivors. These include Dreh'Noha (the central plains), [[Palisades Heath]], the Tharhan Plains, and [[Faehrcyle]]. |
| c. Av2 25-35 | The Drehua peoples in Palisades Heath, one of the very few to survive the Felling, are the first post-Felling civilization to begin recording history once again. Their writings are the strongest remaining evidence of Drehmal's interactions with Drehmari, painting a picture of a kind and wise deity through written "Parables". [[Drehua Temple]] is home to these writings. |
| c. Av2 25-30 | On the northwestern coast of the plains of [[Faehrcyle]], a massive mountain suddenly appears where there was once only ocean. This mountain comes to be known as [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. |
| Av2 32 | [[Tethlaen]], Aspect of Fear, is informed by his sister [[Noha]], Aspect of Meadows, of strange mutations to the life around Mt. Yavhlix. He discovers a massive cavern inside the mountain, centered around a tear in the very fabric of reality. Feeling a deep sense of wrongness, the Ever-Fear attempts to seal the tear, but upon realizing he can only do so effectively from the inside, crosses over to the [[Nothing]]. He is presumed dead for the next ~1500 years. |
| c. Av2 50 | [[Drehmal]], having completed their work in rebuilding the world, finally goes to rest deep inside the [[Primal Caverns]]. They are spotted heading towards the peaks one final time, and have not been seen by anyone in the millennia since. |
| c. Av2 30-100 | Numerous other major Drehmari civilizations begin to form, including the [[First Tharhan Empire]], several city-states in the Central Plains led by [[Drahbes]], tribes of east and west [[Merijool]], the people of [[Ancehl Castle]], and the [[Empire of Vir]] spanning the east. |
| c. Av2 10-100 | [[Maelihs]] converts captured Drehmari into legions of twisted [[Maelmari]] in [[Rhaveloth]], while [[Virtuo]] ascends those she deems worthy into [[Virmari]] at the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. Tensions between the two sides gradually begin to grow. |
| c. Av2 100 | Mael and Virtuo's forces go to war, in a centuries-long conflict known as the [[Deity War]]. Details from this war are sparse, but it is vaguely remembered by today's citizens as an unthinkably bloody series of battles, hindering the growth of new civilizations. |
| ??? (Early/Mid-Av2) | The First Tharhan Empire collapses due to internal strife, and fragments into [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|six warring states]] known as Dehar, Avakea, Loraga, Nimahj, Erxsival, and Salahnar. Simultaneously, a portion of their prisoners sent out to die in the [[Ebony Veldt]] settle in a massive cave system and develop their own advanced society in secret at an underground fortress which comes to be known as [[Caer Adacia]]. |
| ??? (Early/Mid-Av2) | Tehra, the First [[Tehrmari]], a close friend of [[Moen]], is ascended to Tehrmari status. She founds the La'Tehrmari and the Scalebound, its ruling priest class. Shortly afterwards, the two other Founders, Sereven and Froslea, create the other two main factions, the Talon and the Wingmakers, respectively. These ascended people begin to develop civilization on Lo'Dahr alongside the Aspects, centered around the city of [[Naharja]]. |
| Av2 1000 | The Deity War draws to a close. |

### Mid Av2 (Rise of Major Civilizations)

Mid Av2 can be defined as the time between the end of the Deity War in Av2 1000 and the rise of [[Avsohm]], in the final centuries of the era.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c. Av2 1000-1300 | The [[Chosen Kingdom]] unites the people of the Central Plains under a single banner, likely rising out of the city-state of [[Drahbes]]. |
| c. Av2 1020 | A group of [[Virmari]] and [[Drehmari]] venture out into the the far eastern extent of the Verdant Mountains, and found [[Teiruun Monastery]], a place of Virtuo worship and spiritual learning. |
| Av2 1189 | Warrior-King Athrah Zarha founds the city of [[Athrah]] in northern [[Casai]]. Athrah will eventually grow to become one of the largest cities in the world, and is the oldest inhabited city in modern Drehmal. Zarha begins a series of conquests, alliances, and negotiations to create an empire that unites all the tribes of the Casain Peninsula. |
| Av2 1255 | Athrah Zarha's forces, now the [[Casain Empire]], defeat the final tribe outside of their empire, Clan Xorha to the far north of the region. Zarha himself, however, dies in the battle. |
| Av2 1256 | The survivors of Clan Xorha, in an act of mass retribution, are shackled to ships and sent off into the vast ocean to the north. After several weeks, they wash ashore on the mysterious [[Island of Dawn]]. They name this island "Dhuzehl", and settle in its cave systems, forming the settlement of [[Xor'Huul]]. |
| Av2 1320 | The first formal school of [alchemy](/Lore/Magic/Alchemy/), Asomatous Alchemy, is established by Otahnes Magian, building off the first principles theorized at [[Ancehl Castle]] with a focus on the Doctrine of Spheres. |
| Av2 1320-1400 | The Hermetic school of alchemical thought is developed, focusing more on the creation of potions and more mundane physical materials than Asomatous alchemy. |
| c. Av2 1350 | A group of particularly daring Asomatous alchemists forms a concentrated research organization, aimed at completion of the [[Great Work]] at any cost. This society comes to be known as [[Red Dawn]]. |
| Av2 1359 | The [[Empire of Vir]] collapses, leaving a massive power vacuum in the east from the Black Jungle to [[Highfall Tundra]]. |
| Av2 1360 | The peoples of [[Sahd]] make landfall on the southeastern coast of the [[Black Jungle]], and begin sending their prisoners to this land, which they perceive as lawless. |
| Av2 1383 | A group of Lunar Necromancers flee the Chosen Kingdom after facing significant persecution, settling in [[Lorahn'Kahl]]. They would go on to form the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], likely at some point in the next few decades. |
| c. Av2 1400-1500 | The [[Tide Queen]], an extremely powerful individual utilizing the legendary blade [[Masayoshi]], unites the peoples of the Black Jungle under her rule, in a monarchy known as the [[Tidal Dynasty]]. |
| Av2 1455 | The [[Casain Empire]] fights its first major war, the Zephyr War, against the forces of West [[Merijool]]. The Casains suffer a major loss, and turn their attention elsewhere. |
| c. Av2 1470 | The War of Unification is fought in western Drehmal. Forces from the [[Casain Empire]] invade Tharhan, taking advantage of its fractured state and pressing deep into the [[Ebony Veldt]]. Casain forces also invade from the west, having landed on the coasts of [[Anyr'Nogur]] and razing the kingdom of Avakea in the desert. The Casains are repelled by the forces of [[Caer Adacia]], who conquer the entirety of the plains in under a month and crown themselves the new leaders of the [[Second Tharhan Empire]]. Casains are allowed to remain in Anyr'Nogur. |

### Late Av2 (The Avsohmic Era)

The history of late Av2 is nearly identical to the history of the Avsohmic Empire, the major player in almost all political events and major developments of the era's last two to three centuries. The date that the empire is founded is not known, and not many dates are given within this time period, so events are split into the reigns of the three emperors.

#### Reign of Drehn Mal'Sohm

[[Drehn]]'s reign sees the founding and rapid expansion of the Empire of Avsohm, spurred by the discovery of the [[Rehntite Cave]] and Spiral Anomaly at [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. Avsohm comes to dominate the realm in this time, mostly without significant violence due to their clear technological superiority.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c. Av2 1500 | The Rise of Avsohm: The king of the [[Chosen Kingdom]] is assassinated. His son, [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], refuses the crown for thirteen years, citing the deep corruption of the state and his own democratic ideals as reasons he cannot take this mantle. Upon taking the throne, Drehn heavily reforms the kingdom, turning it into the Empire of [[Avsohm]]. |
| c. Av2 1600 | Avsohm moves its capital from Drabyel (not the village found in the map) to a brand new construction, the city of [[Av'Sal]]. |
| c. Av2 1640 | Avsohmic survey drones sent to [[Akhlo'Rohma]] detect a [[Rehntite Cave|massive source of rehntite]] in the mountains, and the site is quickly turned into a mine for the empire. Their use of [[rehntite]] is a major catalyst for Avsohm's extremely rapid development in the coming decades. |
| Av2 1644 | Avsohmic survey drones sent to [[Faehrcyle]] discover a massive source of [[Primal Energy]] deep inside of [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. Drehn and his forces head north to negotiate with the local Frostfang tribes, but are turned away. |
| Av2 1646 | The [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] takes place. An Avsohmic army supposedly led by a rogue general named Hehlvar marches north with the intention of capturing Mt. Yavhlix, and meets the Frostfang Tribes in [[Faehrcyle]]. [[Homli Tahsgan]], leader of the tribes, uses the [[Frostfang]] to call forth a magical blizzard of catastrophic size and intensity. This storm temporarily pushes Avsohm out of the region, but permanently alters the climates of several regions, including [[Casai]], [[Merijool]], the [[Frozen Bite]], and most of all, Faehrcyle. Once a cold but livable plain with a wide variety of wildlife, Faehrcyle is turned into a permanently frozen wasteland. Homli dies, and the tribes are forced to leave their homeland to survive. With no further opposition, Drehn court-martials the general responsible for the conflict, but Avsohm takes the mountain regardless. <br> <br> The [[Divine Schism]] begins, triggered by the events of the Frostfang Catastrophe. [[Noha]] of Meadows dies of grief over losing such a vast swathe of her domain to the blizzard, inspiring the Aspect of Death, [[Voynahla]], to take his own life and ascend to a permanent state of undeath. The Aspects and Tehrmari break out into war on Lo'Dahr. |
| c. Av2 1647-1650 | Avsohm begins operations inside of Mt. Yavhlix, constructing a [[Primary Energy Collection Facility|facility]] for the collection of the primal energy which leaks out of the tear. |
| c. Av2 1650-1700 | Avsohm's control of the realm's most powerful material and a functionally infinite source of primal energy skyrockets them into technological dominance over the rest of the world. Wielding immense power but choosing to take a big stick diplomacy approach, Avsohm comes to dominate the overwhelming majority of the continent by the end of Drehn's reign. |
| ??? | Drehn's Avsohmic forces meet with the forces of the [[Tidal Dynasty]]. Both leaders are wary of the other's strength, and as such, the two sides develop a mutual peace. The Tidal Dynasty is one of very few lands to never fall under Avsohmic rule. |
| c. Av2 1660 | The Divine Schism ends with the murder of Tempest [[Palaesida]] by Abominate [[Maen]], Aspect of Pain. Maen is exiled to the moon of [[Loruhn]], where he is physically shackled to the ground indefinitely. The Aspects, all fearful of their own potential deaths at the hands of one another, flee to various corners of the realm, rarely again showing their physical forms. |
| ??? | The [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]] is founded in Lorahn'Kahl, made up of a group of necromancers seeking to complete the [[Great Work]] through mass manipulation of the dead. |
| ??? | The last [[Virmari]] king of [[Highfall]], Qyhn III, is assassinated by [[Blue Exodus]]. |
| c. Av2 1650-1700 | Avsohm begins to form working relationships with three external organizations: the [[Red Dawn]] alchemical society, the [[Blue Exodus]] military contractors, and the ancient [[Green Serpent]] merchant's guild. |
| c. Av2 1700 | Drehn, in his old age, steps down as Emperor of Avsohm. |

#### Reign of Zorhis Ifeihl

[[Ifeihl]]'s reign was characterized by a slow decline of the empire, as it generally held its territory but fell into an economic recession and a lack of clear progress.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c. Av2 1700 | Zorhis [[Ifeihl]] is chosen as the next Emperor of Avsohm. Popular with the younger generations for his peaceful demeanor and appreciation for the arts, Ifeihl's reign begins with a message of hope, but the empire begins to gradually decline during his time. |
| Av2 1702[^1] | [[Muhs]], Aspect of Beasts, is tracked down and slain by the [[Hunting Party]], a group of mortals seeking to end his life for various reasons. The party's lone survivor is executed in Av'Sal. This marks the final straw for many of the Aspects who still spent time on Drehmal, leading them to withdraw entirely from interacting with mortals. |
| c. Av2 1710-1750 | Ifeihl gradually incorporates Red Dawn, Blue Exodus, and Green Serpent—now known as the "Big Three" into larger and larger roles in the Avsohmic government. By the end of his reign, they are effectively extensions of the empire's government. |
| c. Av2 1730-1740 | The Tri-Moon Theocracy, in response to coastal raids from [[Maelihs]], raises a large army of undead. Small amounts of the horde sometimes break off into other regions, drawing the attention of Avsohm. |
| Av2 1748 | Avsohm infiltrates the Tri-Moon Theocracy and assassinates their High Priests, collapsing the theocracy from the inside. They fully occupy [[Lorahn'Kahl]], repressing any remaining necromancers. The horde of undead, no longer contained, spreads throughout the realm. |
| c. Av2 1750 |  Emperor Ifeihl censors all information concerning operations in Mt. Yavhlix and orders the construction of vaults to store information sensitive to the Avsohmic government, Blue Exodus, Red Dawn and Green Serpent. |
| ??? | Aspect Worship is outlawed in Avsohm, with the state only officially recognizing the worship of [[Virtuo]] or [[Drehmal]]. |
| Av2 1753 | The [[Tide Queen]] slaughters envoys sent by a Sahdan king in retribution for Sahd sending their prisoners to the Black Jungle centuries ago. The Tidal Dynasty begins an effort to isolate Sahd from the mainland, effectively wiping the island from history. |
| c. Av2 1760 | Emperor Ifeihl, facing criticism due to economic recession and the consequences of Avsohm's conflict with the Tri-Moon Theocracy, steps down from his position. He is replaced by Uffeihl [[Anyr]], a highly decorated Avsohmic general. |

#### Reign of Uffeihl Anyr

Anyr's reign, seen as something of a renaissance for Avsohm, was characterized by a newfound patriotism and militant mindset, with Avsohm seeking to expand even further and exploit the natural world as much as possible. The empire did make massive strides during this time, but the reign of Anyr also saw the swift, harsh death of the empire.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c. Av2 1760 | [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] takes the throne, and immediately makes sweeping changes to the empire. Shifting to a more militaristic approach, Anyr moves his ruling cabinet to the city of [[Sal'Anyr]] in the west, closer to the southwestern border with the [[Empire of Maelihs]]. |
| c. Av2 1780-1790 | The flow of Primal Energy at the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] begins to slow down, prompting researchers in the [[Resonant Halls]] to attempt to cross into the Spiral Anomaly for the very first time. This is first done with an extremely advanced runic device, a "Resonant Eye", capable of projecting an image and audio remotely. The researchers discover an entity, [[Tethlaen]], inside the anomaly. <br>Avsohmic officers enter the anomaly. Dozens are massacred by the Ever-Fear, and many in the facility are driven insane. Eventually, Avsohm is able to come to an agreement with the Aspect, and continues collection of Primal Energy while also helping to keep Tethlaen protected from the forces of the [[Nothing]].<br>More dives with the Resonant Eye are conducted, allowing Avsohm to uncover some of the secrets of the universe. This includes the form of the [[Mythbreaker]], which the empire sets out to reconstruct. |
| c. Av2 1800 | Avsohm attempts to use the Resonant Eye to peer beyond the [[Veil]] at the edge of their bubble of space, but are unable to do so. They instead turn their attention to Lo'Dahr. <br>Avsohm constructs facilities on the divine moon, aimed at harnessing the power of the [[Numencore]], the massive stockpile of Primal Energy in the center of the moon. Their research on the moon allows them to create warp technology, allowing for the advent of the [[Terminus Network]]. |
| c. Av2 1810 | Driven by these newfound discoveries, Anyr and Red Dawn begin the Apotheosis Project, an attempt to ascend Anyr to godhood through the construction of a "God Machine". <br>The Mythbreaker is first constructed, but cannot be charged with Primal Energy without crashing the continental power grid. It is separated into pieces for safeguarding. |
| ??? | A crew of Red Dawn officers makes an expedition to Eastern [[Xivrhynt]], the first time that mainland Drehmari have stepped foot on the outer continents since the [[Felling]]. The majority are massacred by strange black orbs, and future plans for an expedition to Western [[Xivrhynt]] begin to stall due to the empire's focus on the Apotheosis Project. |
| Av2 1820 | The [[Fall of Avsohm]]: A massive chain of events unfolds, resulting in the empire's collapse. The vast majority of Avsohm's military and government, beginning in Mt. Yavhlix and spreading throughout the realm, is wiped out by a combination of bizarre monsters or simply disappears. Overnight, the empire's infrastructure is crippled, and the realm is plunged into turmoil. The only survivors among Avsohm's officer class are 24 people who enter indefinite temporal stasis, in a [[Stasis Facility]] near the Primal Caverns. <br>[[Maelihs]], taking advantage of the chaos, invades [[Sal'Anyr]], marking the beginning of the [[Dune Wars]]. The stronghold falls in a day, and Mael goes on to reconquer most of the west.  |

### The Third Avihm (Av3)

The history of the Third Avihm is largely defined by the power vacuum left by Avsohm's demise, and increased conflicts between the Drehmari survivors and the [[Empire of Maelihs]]. Its second half is dominated by the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], the only political entity to come somewhat close to re-creating Avsohm's grip over the realm. Av3 is brought to a close by the departure of [[Virtuo]] and dissolution of Insohm.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Av3 1 | [[Xor'Huul]] is wiped out by a plague and a civil war between its commoners and nobility, brought about when the city's priests attempted to transform themselves into Kohmari, ascended of the Stone Aspect [[Koh]]. |
| c. Av3 1-25 | The Dune Wars: Mael brutally and swiftly reconquers most of Western Drehmal. <br>Mael unleashes the [[Skullbeasts]] on the world, titanic creatures made of twisted bone and flesh which cannot be killed by Drehmari without highly specialized tools. These creatures level Sal'Anyr, among other towns and villages in Mael's path. <br>The war culminates in the use of the [[Skullmother]] over the [[South Heartwood]]. This mysterious, massively powerful creature drops the equivalent of a nuclear bomb on the Heartwood, permanently scorching over half of the largest forest in the realm and claiming untold thousands of lives. | 
| c. Av3 1-10 | The rapid advance of Mael's forces leads to a mass exodus of Casains out of Casai, with most of them ending up in [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. They are immediately persecuted as a racial minority in this new home, particularly due to their worship of the Aspect of Death, [[Voynahla]]. |
| Av3 21 | Red Dawn defector [[Klyhf|Klyhf Him'lahk]] attempts to sacrifice his lord and friend, Maelihs, in order to complete the [[Great Work]]. He fails, and Mael kills him. |
| Av3 39 | The [[Tidal Dynasty]] shuts down its borders to all foreigners, only allowing outsiders to enter the Black Jungle if making pilgrimages to the [[Kiln of Virtuo]] or trading at a designated port (likely either the port at the Kiln or the appropriate district in [[Firteid]]). |
| c. Av3 100 | Racial tensions in Akhlo'Rohma culminate in the Dohval Civil War, with the Casain immigrants and their allies fighting against the oppressive authority figures in the region. The city-state surrounding [[Ancehl Castle]] is burnt to the ground, with only the castle left standing. The Kingdom of Dusps is born and becomes the dominant political force in the region. |
| Av3 298 | The Islands of [[Island of Dusk|Dusk]] and [[Island of Dawn|Dawn]] are rediscovered by mainland Drehmari. |
| Av3 301 | The last documented entrance to the Crypts of Akhlo'Rohma, beneath [[Ancehl Castle]], are buried in a landslide. |
| c. Av3 450-500 | [[Hovadchear|Hovadchear Myrik]] and [[Ultva|Ultva Utofal]] found the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], a loose coalition of eastern states seeking to revitalize trade and eventually fight back against the forces of Maelihs. |
| Av3 509 | An Insohmic professor by the name of Hemfihl reverse engineers airship technology from the Empire of Maelihs. |
| Av3 512 | Airship technology is fully harnessed by Insohm's merchants, allowing for the Coalition to grow in size and influence. The port city of [[Mossfield]] becomes particularly large and prosperous. |
| c. Av3 515 | The Insohmic Trade Wars are fought over newfound trade disputes, with airships fitted for battle. |
| Av3 600 | A massacre of Insohmic civilian militias by separatists starts the [[Insohmic Civil War]] between the separatists (Dusps, Highfall, Faehrcylian tribes) and the loyalists (Provinces of Vir, Federation of Faehrcylian Kingdoms, Gozak and the Insohmic Commonwealth). |
| c. Av3 605 | An airship passes over [[Tidal Dynasty]] airspace, prompting them to join the war as a third party, vaguely aligned with the separatists. |
| Av3 609 | The Tidal Dynasty suffers a defeat at the Gozaki city of Kozdan, and withdraws from the war. |
| Av3 610 | Loyalists take [[Highfall]] after a long siege. |
| Av3 611 | The Insohmic Civil War ends in a loyalist victory after the capture of the Duspian city of Sahvoltha. |
| c. Av3 620 | The Tide Queen starts the Guardian Program to extort ships passing south of the Black Jungle. This angers Insohm, who commissions a secret organization to spy on the Tide Queen and foment unrest. |
| c. Av3 625 | The [[Tide Queen]] is assassinated by forces from within her own empire, leaving a massive power vacuum. This begins the [[Tidal War]], a conflict fought between the Insohm-backed Grand Parish of Virtuo and military officials of the Tidal Dynasty, vying for control of the Black Jungle. |
| c. Av2 630 | In the chaos of the Tidal War, Maelihs and his forces infiltrate the Kiln of Virtuo. He bests Virtuo in combat and tears out her eye, but stops short of killing her. Riding a wave of sympathy, the Grand Parish takes control of the war and emerges victorious, adding the Parochial Enclave of Firteid to Insohm's ranks. |
| c. Av2 645-650 | The [[Battle for Drehmal]], a long war of reconquest and liberation of Western Drehmal, begins between the forces of Insohm (bolstered by rediscovered Avsohmic technology) and Maelihs. |
| ???[^2] | Two clans are exiled from Naharja for engaging in acts of gang warfare on the streets, and they go to form the Empire of Rohei. These Ro'Tehrmari come to be heavily persecuted by the Talon, to the point that some hide away in caves rather than risk encountering the La'Tehrmari. |
| ??? | The Prismatic Council of the Aspects determines that the Talon have become too powerful and corrupt, and decide to elevate a chosen Tehrmari to become their personal servant. This Tehrmari is [[Yriel|Yriel Rezhad]], the Moonsworn. |
| ??? | Yriel's first major act as the Moonsworn is to enter [[Ytaj]] and massacre the Talon, including Sereven, greatly leveling the playing field between La' and Ro'Tehrmari. |
| c. Av3 840 | [[Ultva]], the other Master of Insohm, goes insane over his people's inability to fully piece together Avsohm's technology and access its greatest secrets. He disappears into an [[Avsohmic Vault]], and is never seen again. |
| Av3 847 | [[Castle Hovadchear]], the capital of the Order of Insohm, mysteriously disappears, taking Master Hovadchear himself with it. The Order is forced to relocate its operations to the [[Insohmic Library]] and the [[ICS Arbiter]]. |
| c. Av3 860 | A heated meeting aboard the ICS Arbiter leads to a passionate speech about the need for unity against Maelihs, given by [[Vahid]], a high-ranking [[Virmari]] in Virtuo's Grand Parish serving as a representative of Firteid in the Insohmic Council. Vahid is appointed Master of Insohm and leads a revitalized war effort to retake the west. |
| Likely Av3 878[^3] | With Insohm pushing into the west and suddenly posing a real threat, the Empire of Maelihs prepares a legion of Skullbeasts, but the Burnt Generals are ordered not to deploy the Skullmother again. |
| Likely Av3 885[^4] | Insohm reclaims [[Caer Adacia]] from Mael's armies, and continues advancing into the Tharhan Plains. |
| Likely Av3 887[^5] | Maelihs frees the [[Skullmother]], setting her free into the ocean. |
| c. Av3 895-900 | At the climax of the Battle for Drehmal, [[Yriel]] is sent to intervene, but is slain in a duel against [[Vahid]]. |
| Likely Av3 900[^6] | The Battle for Drehmal comes to an end, with Maelihs and Virtuo reaching a peace treaty. The vast majority of the west, with the exception of [[The Carmine]] and [[Hellcrags]], are restored to Drehmari control under Insohm. |
| c. Av3 901 | A deeply grief-stricken Maelihs visits Western [[Xivrhynt]], the place of his birth, in an attempt to learn about his true origins. |
| Av3 902 | [[Khive]], seeing Mael's journey to Xivrhynt, summons both him and [[Virtuo]] to [[Ytaj]]. He explains the entirety of the two deities' birth, incited by the [[Maelruhn]] and [[Viruhn]], to the duo. Mael is disgusted to learn of the apparent atrocities of these ancient people, and wishes to be able to apologize to his sister. |
| Av3 903 | Virtuo, aimless after centuries of war against Mael and feeling powerless, is reminded of the survivors in Eastern Xivrhynt by [[Mari]] at a meeting of the Prismatic Council. She resolves to leave for the eastern edge of the disc to heal the people and the land there, where she feels she is needed most. Virtuo takes her Grand Parish, the symbol of the dominant religious and political force in the realm, and simply leaves to the east, without informing the people of the mainland. |

### The Fourth Avihm (Av4)

Av4, the current era, is still very young. The departure of Virtuo and Vahid led to the dissolution of Insohm, and as such, practically no larger political entities exist on Drehmal anymore. The influence of the gods is almost never felt, with much of the continent reeling from their patron Goddess abandoning them, and technologically advanced civilization is a thing of the past.

| **Date** | **Event Description** |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| c. Av4 1-10 | The Insohmic Council crumbles without a leader or the stable influence of Virtuo's Grand Parish. Riots destroy Old Mossfield, the Akhlo'Rohman countryside is pillaged by Maelmari forces, and civilization largely reverts back to small city-states. |
| Av4 12 | Overwhelmed by grief and self-loathing, Maelihs finally decides that he can no longer remain in the [[Burnt Palace]]. He leaves to be with the Aspects in [[Ytaj]], vowing to one day return and destroy his creations. |
| Av4 26 | West and East Merijool, who feuded for millennia over their worship of [[Lai]] and [[Loe]], respectively, unite into a single agnostic republic for the first time. |
| Av4 100 | The player(s), members of the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Stasis_Eight/), are released from temporal stasis in the [[Stasis Facility]] after an emergency evacuation is triggered. The main story of the map begins here. |

[^1]: One source, [[The Hunting of Greatbeast Muhs]], gives this date, while an advancement for finding the Underwood area gives the date of the Hunting as Av2 1583. 
[^2]: It is incredibly unclear when these events in Tehrmari politics occur, as their stories have functionally no dates listed. However, these developments seem to have come between the Divine Schism and the next crossover between Tehrmari and Drehmari history, the Battle for Drehmal, so they are put here.
[^3]: This date comes from [[Dahroc's Notes]], and is actually written in-map as Av3 678. However, this date does not seem to line up with other sources, and has thus been moved up by 200 years to closely coincide with the end of Av3, as other books suggest is the case.
[^4]: This date comes from [[Dahroc's Notes]], and is actually written in-map as Av3 685. However, this date does not seem to line up with other sources, and has thus been moved up by 200 years to closely coincide with the end of Av3, as other books suggest is the case.
[^5]: This date comes from [[Dahroc's Notes]], and is actually written in-map as Av3 687. However, this date does not seem to line up with other sources, and has thus been moved up by 200 years to closely coincide with the end of Av3, as other books suggest is the case.
[^6]: This date comes from [[Dahroc's Notes]], and is actually written in-map as Av3 700. However, this date does not seem to line up with other sources, and has thus been moved up by 200 years to closely coincide with the end of Av3, as other books suggest is the case.
