> The spear is a… perfect catalyst. It defies every known law of the arcane. The energy signature of it we received surpasses the total amount of primal energy collected by this facility in its whole lifetime. Furthermore… it appears we may have an idea of how to forge it. The blades match the theoretical composition of a material created through graviton-forging. I’ve sent the data to my friends Kovis and Kahmas over at Blue Exodus R&D. Kovis is the realm’s leading expert on graviton theory after all, maybe she’ll have some ideas.
