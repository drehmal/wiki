# Mossfield

![[Mossfield1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Mossfield** (technically known as **New Mossfield**) is an official town in the [[Spearhead Forest]] region, in the east of the continent of Drehmal. The only remaining stronghold of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]], Mossfield is a smaller town built adjacent to the ruins of what was once the Order's greatest city. It can be accessed from the road that leads through the [[Verdant Labyrinth]] to its south, or from the north.

New Mossfield is a moderate-sized town in Drehmal, located on a peninsula in southeastern Spearhead Forest. The buildings are primarily made of spruce/oak wood, stone bricks, cobblestone, and moss roofs.

Entering Mossfield for the first time grants the "Children of Virtuo" advancement.

> The in-game map of Mossfield, near the center of town.

### City Center

The center of Mossfield is home to 5 of its 6 unique merchants, as well as the town map. Several wool lines connect from buildings around the center of town to a single spruce wood post.

### Chapel of Virtuo

The Chapel of Virtuo is the only building in Mossfield made entirely out of stone bricks, immediately to the right upon entering the town. The town's graveyard is found at its side, and a statue of [[Virtuo]] welcomes the player on their left immediately upon entering the town, with a glistering melon slice and two pieces of dried kelp at its base.

### Graveyard

Six graves have buried chests beneath them in Mossfield's graveyard.

### Mossfield Library

The Mossfield Library is a relatively small building in southeastern Mossfield, which contains only one bookâ€”[[Old Mossfield]], which gives a short overview of the history of Mossfield's storied predecessor.

### Old Mossfield Inn

The town's inn is located on the northern side of the city center, with the Primal Cache room at the end of a narrow hallway on the upper floor.

### Docks

Docks are found on Mossfield's eastern and northern shores, with a larger trading vessel in the north and one smaller boat to the southeast.

## Lore

Mossfield was originally constructed as a small port city by an ancient kingdom, and gradually grew in size before its population skyrocketed with the advent of airships. Mossfield's location made it an incredibly popular trade hub in the Third Avihm, and within a decade of this advancement, it became the most populous city in the [[Spearhead Forest]]. Subsequently, the city was selected as the capital for the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. (1) As more kingdoms joined the Order, Mossfield continued to grow even larger and became the largest known city in [[Drehmari]] history. 
{ .annotate }

1. Sources are conflicted on whether Mossfield or [[Castle Hovadchear]] was the true capital of Insohm, but both were extremely prominent locations in the heart of the Order.

Mossfield was a hub of culture, knowledge, art, industry, and trade. However, as relations within the order became unsteady in late Av3, riots ensued, and for Mossfield's immense size and diversity, it was all but destroyed. New Mossfield lies west of the ruins of Old Mossfield, where only the [[Insohmic Library]] off the coast is left standing. Mossfield remains a bastion of Virtuo's faith and is the only remaining town to be truly governed by Insohm, but it has shrunk into relative obscurity since the Goddess' departure, only maintaining some connections to other settlements in its region.

## Extras

### Soundtrack

Mossfield's theme song is "Port Town", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
