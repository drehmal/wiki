## Transcription
> A young initiate came to me today with a curious discovery. She had stumbled upon the entrance to a cave, and upon peeking inside sighted a curious style of ancient architecture. This confused me immensely, as I had thought that we Star-Kin has been the only inhabitants on this island (barring the exceedingly rare witch or alchemist). For a group to have escaped our notice for centuries... why, they must have lived, worked, and died entirely underground! I have already sent my initiate back to the cave to find out more; it's likely nothing has lived there for Years.
