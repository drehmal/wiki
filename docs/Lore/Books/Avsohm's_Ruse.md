This book can be found on a lectern in [[Ancehl Castle]]. Its contents are an allegation that Avsohm fabricated the three schools of Alchemy, when in fact, they are all one. It is one of three books in the room with the "Dusty Memo," which hints at a [[Ancehl Castle#Dusty Memo|puzzle involving the books]].

## Transcription
> The Avsohmic Empire would have us believe in the existence of three distinct schools of Alchemy: Asomatous, Hermetic, and Bionic. This is an elaborate and revisionist fiction invented and propped up by corrupt Avsohmic academics and industrialists in order to restrict and classify the fluid art of Alchemy. The truth is: all schools are one and the same. They all tap into the same Primal truth at the heart of every living being. Everything with a soul responds to the Alchemical arts, but Avsohm would much rather reduce it to a sterile science. They are committed to this ruse (indeed, many in Avsohm have probably internalized it, not thinking twice about the status quo), but the truth is that this scheme was enacted for the sole purpose of profit and power. Avsohm needed to industrialize art, industrialize Alchemy, so they sanitized it, disfigured it, and paraded the corpse in their lecture halls and universities. Now, Avsohm has all the power and profit in the world, but they have lost their soul. The hubris of Avsohm will be their downfall, mark my words, for anyone who thinks they can restrict the power of Alchemy is a fool like no other.
