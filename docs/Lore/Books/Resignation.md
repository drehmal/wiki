 

This book can be found in a chest in a small camp outside [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. It is written by an Insohmic official who had been attempting to open the gate to the facility within the mountain, but has effectively given up after finding no way to enter.

## Transcription
> This is it. The last day of excavations. How many years of my life have been lost out among these endless snowdrifts, howling winds, and no life to speak of aside from our team?
>
> I’m old enough to remember when Master Ultva first began efforts to enter the facility within Mount Yavhlix. I was only a scribe back then, but the idea of traveling up there took root and sprouted in my mind until it was all I could think of. After all, the Avsohmic texts we have found mention it more than any other location in that ancient empire.
>
> And so one day, I made the journey up past the pipes in Akhlo'Rohma and Faehrcyle to this place for the first time myself. But then, as now, the gate stood in our way.
>
> We have tried every runic or alchemical means under the Torahn to open it, and it still resists. We have tried tunneling past it, and more of the material we call “nullstone” stops our progress. Now we’re just trying to dig up the outbuildings in a last-ditch effort to find an opening mechanism.
>
> If we don't find anything today, we're going home. It looks like whatever secrets within were entombed when the last Avsohmic official perished.
>
> Abandon all hope, you who find this account. There is nothing but bitter disappointment ahead.
