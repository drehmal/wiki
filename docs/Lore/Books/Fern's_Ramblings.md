This book can be found on a lectern in [[Mossfield]]. It contains the writing of a worried old teacher, who establishes that multiple young residents of the town have gone on pilgrimages and not returned, causing her to be concerned about [[Juniper's Journal|Juniper Quarryman's journey with her sickly younger brother]] to [[Teiruun Monastery]].

## Transcription
> Perhaps it is a tad cliche for an old woman to be so concerned about the young people of this city, but these pages shouldn't speak unless I allow them to!
>
> Yesterday, young Juniper Quarryman announced her intention to bring little Thom out of town to ask for the Serene Mother's blessed healing at the Order of Teiruun.
>
> Poor Thom has been a pale, sickly thing as of late, all bent over with cough. Juniper is a brave girl, though, and as capable as they come. Thom is lucky to have such a dependable sister! Nonetheless, although my teaching years are now behind me, I cannot help but worry that this might be the last time I see my former student.
>
> We all grow up and grow tired of a complacent life. Myself and Brooks traveled for a spell, and ventured all the way to the wide eaves of Firteid and the glistening domes of the Kiln itself. But we came back at First Thaw and never again strayed far beyond the loving arms of family and friends.
>
> The youth of today are different, I tell you!
>
> Just two summers ago, Gahvin Stonemount left for the South. He was the strongest and most spiritually devout pupil I had ever had the pleasure of mentoring. He probably taught me more than I taught him!
>
> But Gahvin never has returned here. The Stonemounts are beside themselves with worry, and I fear they may soon give up hope.
>
> Flora Bloomsbury was another who set off for the Kiln last year. She had the finest voice I had ever heard, and was just as reverent as Gahvin.
>
> But lo and behold! Flora hasn't returned yet either. Nor have Cora Cidermaker or Horas Bale (though I truthfully have less faith in the foraging skills of those two.)
>
> Needless to say, Thom and Juniper will be foremost in my heart in the coming days. Though perhaps I should not fret so much! Mossfielders know that Teiruun Monastery has been a friend of the city since the Insohmic days.
>
> And Abbot Balthysar, the current head monk, is the very model of a scholarly man of the cloth.
>
> The weather should not be too bad, either. Brooks would always say that when Loruhn and Lorahn make a triangle with Lo'Dahr in the night sky, it is time to leave in order to get to the Kiln and back before winter.
>
> As a teacher, students are the light that guides MY path. May Virtuo bring them ALL home safely. Even Horas, although he was always the difficult one.
>
> I do look forward to having a long talk with Juniper about her travels over tea when she returns!
