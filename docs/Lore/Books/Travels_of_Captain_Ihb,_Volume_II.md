## Transcription
> My name is Captain Ihb, the greatest pirate known to Drehmal! In these pages I shall regale you with the tales of my second great adventure, to the deep south-east. Legends tell of a beautiful island, full of rolling fields of wheat and trees with pink blossoms. I'm happy to tell you that these rumors are true! Indeed, the island of Sahd is the most picturesque thing I have ever seen. It is a shame few know of such a wondrous place. I found no mention of it in many records, despite the size of the island. Perhaps it is due to the frosty disposition of the local people?
