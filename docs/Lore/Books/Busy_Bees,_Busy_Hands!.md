> To worship Vayniklah is to improve life for the living. Just as plants are happier with fertilizer, Drehmari are happier with mead! To that end, I told my friends to find the best possible **recipe**. Now, itâ€™s time to go across Akhlo'Rohma and **visit their stills**. I am sure that their ingredients will please Her!
