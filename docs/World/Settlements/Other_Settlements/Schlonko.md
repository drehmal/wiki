# Schlonko

![[schlonko.png]]

**Schlonko** is a small settlement situated on [[Faehrcyle's]] western coast, within the small patch of forest that remains from the region's pre-[[Frostfang Catastrophe]] climate. Being the only settlement in the Faehrcyle region, Schlonko has no roads leading to it, its main entrance being a small dock.

!!! abstract "Location"
    Approximate Coordinates: `1104, 64, -3036`

Schlonko is home to a shrine known as the "Crystalline Colonnade", which is the [[devotion]] site for [[Loe]].

The town is populated entirely by [[Drehmari]] and is home to a [[Runic Blacksmith]].

## Layout/Points of Interest

Schlonko is composed of no more than ten buildings, most of them being small houses made of spruce, oak, and dark oak wood. 

### Ted's Bait Shop

The first visible building at the town's entrance, Ted's Bait Shop contains various basic fishing-related loot.

### The Ravishing Raftsman Shipbuilders

A small boathouse on Schlonko's coast, featuring a few wooden boats and an assortment of axes. Its western outer wall has a funny meme reference depicted with item frames.

### The Flop

The hamlet's only tavern, located at the western side of Schlonko. It contains a smoker, a clownfish, and wool of various colors in item frames acting as "decoration."

### The Duke's Benevolence Grand Hotel

A small inn southeast of the bait shop. It contains a reception area and two comically small rooms, with room for a bed and nothing more.

### The Duke's Royal Palace/Crystalline Colonnade

The largest structure in the town by a large margin, the Palace in actuality is the Crystalline Colonnade, a temple devoted to [[Loe|Glacial Elder Loe]]. Constructed mainly from stone brick, ice, and quartz, it has been reappropriated by the Duke as his personal abode. Alongside the devotion altar to Loe and various offerings, the Duke has made additions of his own, with a haphazardly made wooden throne and a table with a wooden boat for seating. A Relic Vessel can be found under the ice spike in the center of the temple, which the Duke seems to be using to preserve fish. 

## Loe Devotion Guide

The Crystalline Colonnade is home to Loe's Devotion site, and grants the "Finders Keepers" advancement when first discovered. Items scattered around the shrine's inner room provide hints as to Loe's low-level preferred offerings, including leather, glow lichen, and glass. The hint book for her higher level devotion offerings reads:

> We have grown impatient as of late. Another new pit of **strange soft snow** has opened up around our Arch-Ducal Castle! Despite throwing all of those things **into the pits** like the Loe Follower said!
>
> Though new pits are showing up less, we wish they would just stop for good!

This refers to the pockets of powdered snow in the area. At the bottom of these pits, players will find item frames that hold the Aspect of Cold's most beloved offerings.

Like all other devotion sites, a [[Trinkets#Relic Vessel|Relic Vessel]] is found at the Crystalline Colonnade. This location's relic vessel is found in a chest underneath the central divine ice pillar.

## Unique Villagers

### Runic Blacksmith

The [[Runic Blacksmith]] in Schlonko is located in the house behind Ted's Bait shop, in a small smithy outside of the house, beneath a wool awning with the merchants' signature blue pattern. This blacksmith offers two artisan items, whose details can be found [[Artisan Items#Schlonko|here]].

**Coordinates:** (1097, 65, -3018)

| 18 Scales <br> Shield | *Shield* |

## Lore

Schlonko acts as the capital of the Duchy of Hishrin, which is ruled by Archduke Hishrin Elsahr Ombahr Drehn-Anyr Hovadchear Vahidson I. The Archduke is depicted to be both highly egotistical and completely incompetent: a a small inn is advertised as a grand hotel named in the Duke's honor, the ruins of a temple to Loe is claimed to be his Palace, his staff of power is a fishing rod. Residents pay expensive tithes to the Duke.

There is something of an unsolved mystery surrounding Schlonko, as its residents seem to be uniquely unintelligent. It seems that this was not always the case, as Schlonko is the capital of what was a real Duchy (at least at one time), and it is not clear why the people are this way. It may also be the case that the current residents of the town are not its original inhabitants.

A dark grey tent located south of Schlonko contains a diary detailing a Drehmari from Dusps, fleeing to Lorahn'Kahl to escape execution. The Drehmari suffers from a disease seemingly transforming him into an undead, cursed upon him by a necromancer in Lorahn'Kahl. In some versions of the map, an actual zombie mob was found here.
