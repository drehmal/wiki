## Transcription
> How strange, my mortal friend, that you would ask a Tehrmari of all people for directions to the Kiln of Virtuo! Lucky for you, I know it lies on an island in the center of an inland sea, connected to the outskirts of the great city of Firteid and the Black Jungle beyond by a long bridge. Truly, one of my great regrets is never getting to see the Lady of the Mirror arise from Her home beneath the Kiln's central pool to welcome the daily throngs of pilgrims.
