## Location/Summary
This book can be found on a lectern in a room packed with bookshelves in western [[Ytaj]]. It contains an ode to [[Tethlaen]], wishing for his eventual safe return. The book has been speculated to have been written by [[Moen]], due to the term "sibling" used for Tethlaen, of which the only two are [[Maen]] and [[Moen]], and another room in the area appears to belong to Maen.
