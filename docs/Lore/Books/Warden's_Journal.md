> I thought I was so clever, surrounding myself in flowers. Look at me, still as wretched as ever. This accursed stench refuses to leave me. Every waking moment I am hounded by the smell of rotting flesh. That damn prisoner, the necromancer, she did this to me. I won't ever forgive her. Now, Insohm thinks they can drop their blunders on me. That stupid Coven of Potentia, bah. They finally achieve their goal and it turns her into a fiery maniac. Serves them right, I suppose. Meddling with nature like that is sure to go badly.
