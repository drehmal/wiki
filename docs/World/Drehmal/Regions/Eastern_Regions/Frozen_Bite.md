# Frozen Bite

![[FB_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Frozen Bite** is a region in northeastern [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. The region consists of a range of tundras, woods, mountains and islands. The name "Frozen Bite" may refer to its vaguely mouth-shaped northeastern coast.

## Geography

The Frozen Bite is located in Drehmal's northeast corner. It is separated from [[Faehrcyle]] to the west by a mountain range, and it borders [[Highfall Tundra]] to the south. The region is surrounded by open, iceberg-filled waters on its north and east sides, and the north coast is lined with mountains.

The Frozen Bite's landscape varies greatly. Plants are more common in the eastern half, with spruce trees being widely present, while the western half is more barren, snowy and rocky. Most of the region's land is flat, with the exception of the mountains in the west and the rocky shores and islands in the east.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:** <br>
- Flat, treeless area with ground made of gravel and dirt in southwest <br>
- Tundra sparsely populated by plants with small pools and streams in south <br>
- Large caldera in the east with flat inner ground, populated by acacia and spruce trees <br>
- Rugged shoreline and islands with stone striped with purple, gray and brown along eastern coast <br>
- Gravelly area with large, floating or semi-floating chunks of snowy, rocky land with icy bottoms in west leading to Faehrcyle <br>
- Glacial valley/floe in the far north

There are no major settlements in the Frozen Bite.

## History

Very little is known about the history of the Frozen Bite. The [[Empire of Vir]] may have expanded into the region in the early/mid Second Avihm, however there isn't enough evidence to confirm. The region has largely consisted of wilderness that has seldom been explored by outsiders, being loosely populated by "barbarians" that the [[Kingdom of Highfall]] wished to keep out of their territory. The environment was likely warmer and more hospitable to flora and fauna before the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], although its impact on the region was mitigated by the mountains between the Frozen Bite and Faehrcyle.

> The Frozen Bite tower.

The Frozen Bite's Terminus tower sits in the region's east, inside of a vast caldera. It stands in a large pit with a pool of lava at the bottom, and a parkour course made of floating chunks of ice spirals upwards from the edge of the pit to the top of the tower. Along the bottom edge is a small, abandoned cabin with a sign reading "Uhl Fahn Gonzo" next to its door. There are no hostile enemies present.
