## Transcription
> I’m quickly learning that life aboard the Aphelion is never dull. Earlier today, we spotted the imperial palanquin making its way over to the landing bay! It was the first time since I was chosen to join the research team that Emperor Anyr has graced us with his presence.
>
> And what a presence it was. The whole crew gathered in the Emperor’s throne room and knelt on either side of the aisle, our foreheads touching the cold marble floor. Several minutes passed.
>
> Finally, Emperor Anyr himself appeared, followed by Empresses Elzahra and Azehl, and a shy young girl who I did not recognize at first, but later learned was Princess Anyra. The royal entourage was absolutely dazzling, with sumptuous red and white fabrics adorned with gold and gemstones of all colors. I wanted to lift my head to get a better view, but Eijoor caught my eye and sternly pointed back at the ground.
>
> After a short while, the Emperor took a seat on his throne while his family continued to the right and back behind us to their private quarters. When they had passed, he spoke in a surprisingly quiet voice: “Lift your heads and stand”.
>
> We all got to our feet and stared stiffly forwards, at attention. The Emperor smiled warmly and addressed us again: “My friends, it is truly a privilege to once again be with you. I have many things to discuss with Commander Verpyne and Senior Researcher Vehmil. But before I do, I want to say a few words to everyone gathered here.”
>
> Around the room, shoulders loosened and occasional smiles appeared on faces. I felt it too. When Emperor Anyr spoke in that hushed but perfectly precise tone, it felt like he was  addressing me directly. I have never met anyone quite as skilled at oration. But before I could process those thoughts, he continued: “Already, the Aphelion has contributed more to the health, convenience, and happiness of Drehmari than any other creation of our empire except perhaps the Primary Energy Collection Facility at Mt. Yavhlix.”
>
> Pausing to stretch his broad shoulders, Emperor Anyr tensed and then relaxed back into his throne. "I think, however, that this vessel can do even more to help our realm. I have had a vision, you see. A vision of this very craft rising beyond all limits to make discoveries that our ancestors could not have even dreamed of. Except, perhaps, Drehn Mal'Sohm.” At this, Emperor Anyr leaned forwards, eyes burning brightly. “I want you to help me. Anything you can do to help your superiors on this vessel, do it to the best of your ability. Do it right, and don’t hesitate to get back to work even when you feel you can’t continue. Winning a war is never easy. And you are on the front lines of Avsohm, fighting to ensure that all of us can continue to live in comfort and happiness as long as the Serpent allows!”
>
> Emperor Anyr then stood up, flinging out his arm as his voice was suddenly a whirlwind. "It is time! You are dismissed, so go and serve the Empire. Hail to Avsohm.”
>
> We all spoke as one with a hearty “Hail to Avsohm”, and the room erupted into cheers and commotion. Within a couple of minutes, Eijoor and I found ourselves walking silently back to our
stations in the Science Wing. For the rest of the day, I was filled with a ceaseless determination.
>
> It is little wonder to me now why life has improved so much under Emperor Anyr’s reign. I feel energized and renewed, despite the increasingly long hours. It really is true-  There is no job quite like this one!
