## Transcription
> This is the most advanced piece of technology we have ever created. An intelligent, adaptive computational system. We’ve placed it in control of major systems like the **Terminus network**, where it manages diagnostics and makes sure everything stays running. If it were to ever go down… no, that’s not worth thinking about. **As long as Avsohm stands tall, avSYS should remain operational**. Hail to Avsohm!
