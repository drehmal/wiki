# Lo'Dahr Settlements

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "LD_spoiler.md"

Scattered throughout the map of [[Lo'Dahr]] are many different settlements. These settlements vary greatly in size, from populations of less than 20 to over 100 inhabitants. Settlements can be categorized into ["official" towns](/World/Late-Game/Settlements/Official_Towns/), which always have an [[Adventuring Merchant]], a special [[Advancements|advancement]] for discovering them under the "Civilization" category, and an inn of some sorts. The only official town in Lo'Dahr is [[Naharja]]. There are also many ["unofficial" settlements](/World/Settlements/Other_Settlements/) across the map that are usually smaller.
