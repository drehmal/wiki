The **Resonant Halls** are an end-game story location, accessed after [[Azimuth Labs]]. The Halls are located in the deepest recesses of [[Mt. Yavhlix]], only accessible through a passageway that is initially sealed by veilstone. This seal is only removed once the player has reached its dedicated end-game sequence. If the player approaches the entrance to the halls before this sequence, they are given the message, "The emptiness in your soul feels strongest here."

The Resonant Halls contain some of the final secrets regarding Avsohm's truest ambitions, including arguably their greatest piece of technology and the actions that ultimately led to their downfall. 

## Story
Once the player makes it back to the [[Terminus Network|Terminus]], they are given another item by the yellow-possessed [[avSYS]]. This trinket, the *Resonant Thing*, tells the player: "Deep within the mountain of holes, lies a place that will empty your soul."

Returning to Mt. Yavhlix, the mysterious voice returns to give the player a cryptic message: a direct quotation of the [[Stranded Thesis]]. It disappears until the player reaches the seal, returning only to break it and beckon the player forward into the halls.

The Resonant Halls are a winding, maze-like area, intended to be difficult to navigate in order to protect the room at its core. Over the course of the journey through, however, a few books provide insight into Avsohm's actions at this facility.

It is revealed through transcriptions of dives into the Nothing that [[Tethlaen]], the Aspect that the player slew in the Nothing, had entered for noble reasons, intending to save the realm by holding the tear closed and preventing the dangerous influx of [[Primal Energy]]. They developed a strong rapport with [[Orix Cehein]] over the course of at least 27 conversations, and appear to have cooperated with Avsohm's expeditions into the dimension, even becoming friendly towards the empire. After navigating through multiple labyrinthine areas and a dark, completely flooded room, the player eventually reaches the secret at the core of the facility: The Resonant Eye.

> The room housing the Resonant Eye.

The Resonant Eye was, as some writings here attest, possibly Avsohm's greatest creation. A near-perfectly optimized runic catalyst, the Eye was capable of projecting images from other locations, including those beyond the tear, to the room where it was physically located in Mt. Yavhlix. There are 15 total holotexts in this facility, all found within this very room, and they tell the tale of Avsohm's interactions with the Eye.

On the very first dive, the Eye was only able to make out the shape of wings, presumably those of Tethlaen, before the dive was aborted out of fear. On the second dive, the Avsohmic researchers were able to establish contact with Tethlaen, but could not communicate clearly, and decided to physically enter the tear. This was met with extreme violence from the Aspect, who slaughtered 41 members of the team—all except for the CSO, [[Eleis]], who survived, but was paralyzed from the neck down.

Gradually, Avsohm was able to create a more positive relationship with Tethlaen, negotiating a deal that allowed them to collect energy from the tear while also helping to restore Tethlaen's body, which had been battered by the Nothing. 

The third dive, however, was markedly more groundbreaking for Avsohm. Attempting to look even further into the Nothing, this dive discovered an untold number, estimated to be in the trillions, of other signals within the Nothing, interpreted as other realms. This discovery—that Drehmal was one of an absurdly high number of realms—was earth-shattering to the researchers, learning that the stars were not stars, but rather, functionally other universes. One signal in particular was astronomically brighter than the rest, and this signal became the focus of the fourth dive.

Dive #4, focused on the largest signal, was perhaps even more disturbing to the researchers. It revealed two images: what appeared to be the tip of [a spear](Mythbreaker), and a court of some kind. More prominently, though, it also returned an additional message: "I SEE YOU," from an unknown entity. This spear would eventually become the Mythbreaker, Avsohm's greatest weapon, but the nature of the court was never determined before the fall.

While many of the workers at Mt. Yavhlix were horrified by the results of the third and fourth dives, Emperor [[Anyr]]'s reaction was the opposite. He was overjoyed at the news that they were not alone in the universe, seeing the existence of other realms as an opportunity to expand their empire even further. His ambition, it is revealed, was to conquer all of the realms in existence, spreading Avsohm to its absolute fullest extent, and challenging the being who may have created the Mythbreaker with the blade itself.

The final log before the end is a note about the completion of the God Machine at [[Azimuth Labs|Azimuth]], noting that the charging of the [[Mythbreaker]] will certainly anger [[Khive]], and that Anyr will need to be ascended to fight back. However, it also notes that the power draw from the God Machine is massive, and firing it prematurely would surely crash the entire Avsohmic power grid.

The final log is written by an unknown staffer at the facility, after an emergency had been declared at Yavhlix. From their writing, we learn that the God Machine was fired early, crashing the power network and causing the Eye to activate on its own, prompting Orix to leave and put the seal in place. It appears that at this point, Those Beyond began to invade Mt. Yavhlix, consuming Avsohm and bringing about the empire's doom.

As the player takes in these revelations and tries to leave, the voice returns, offering them a portal out to the main Primary Collection Facility. Here, it tells the player that they have one more destination on their journey: the voice's Court.

## Gameplay
When the player enters the Resonant Halls from the Primary Collection Facility, they are placed into Adventure Mode, unlike the main portion of Mt. Yavhlix. 

The entirety of the Resonant Halls are built in a labyrinthine style, with three distinct areas that the player must navigate through. In all three areas, the player will have to maneuver around Hole Remnants, invulnerable enemies that appear as only a dark head.

The first area is a large room filled with evenly spaced pillars, with a hole down to the void in the center. There is a staircase downwards that the player must find to progress.

The staircase takes the player to a set of three iron doors, all of which open up to the same area: the second labyrinth. Here, the player will progress by finding another staircase, this time leading upward.

    This labyrinth can be navigated as follows: <br>

At the top of the staircase, the player can access some non-gameplay rooms, such as a library room, but will eventually come to a large hole, dropping down into a massive, water-filled room with large pipes. In this section, the third major area, the player will be given the Blindness effect, and must navigate between small pockets of air surrounded by glass bubbles, while also avoiding swimming Hole Remnants. This area can be quite difficult to navigate at times, but the exit is found in the third distinct room of this area, which is much more tightly packed with pipes than the other two.

Once the player has completed this section, they will find an iron door that opens to the end of the second area, opening a shortcut for themselves or other players. Just up another staircase is the Resonant Eye room, which contains all of the location's holotexts and progresses the story.

## Original Writing
There are [15 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-Yav/Resonant_Halls) found in the Resonant Halls, all at the Resonant Eye.

There are also four lore books to be found at this location: three transcriptions of conversations between [[Orix Cehein]] and [[Tethlaen]] during Resonance Dives, and one book describing the Resonant Eye project at large. <br>

## Lore
There is little lore to the Resonant Halls that is not simply a part of the main story.

Multiple pertinent Avsohmic officers are known to have spent time here, predominantly [[Orix Cehein]] as the facility's commanding officer, [[Eleis]] and later [[Thresa Vera]] as CSO, and [[Cehva|Researcher Cehva]].
