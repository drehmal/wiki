### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in an item frame at [[Dahr's Shrine]] in [[Port Solitude]]. It is not a writable book, but rather contains a hint as to the accepted [[Devotion]] items for Abyssal Elder [[Dahr]].

### Transcription:
> On a foggy day, I invite in any captain that arrives in port for a drink and a prayer. They're either a fellow saltblood who knows to place an offering to Dahr **on the prow of their ship**, or they're a living corpse who needs every bit of help they can get from a priest like me. Either way, it's a good time.
