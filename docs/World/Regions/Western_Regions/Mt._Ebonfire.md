# Mt. Ebonfire

![[EB_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Mt. Ebonfire** is an ash-covered region in western [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. It is named after the large volcano, Mt. Ebonfire, at its core, which is surrounded by a separate ring of mountains.

## Geography

The Mt. Ebonfire region is located on the western coast of the continent. It is bordered by [[Casai]] to the north, [[Merijool]] to the northeast, and the [[Ebony Veldt]] to the east and south.

The region has a barren, gray landscape with little vegetation, other than the occasional patch of dry grass with spruce trees. The terrain is mostly flat with a few black and gray crags, and the ground consists mainly of gravel. Lava pools are also commonplace throughout the area. The region is ringed with black and gray mountains, and Mt. Ebonfire itself, a large volcano with a lava-filled cavity at its summit, stands in the region's center, surrounded by a natural moat.

The town of [[Ebonrun]] is located at the region's northern edge, next to a reservoir restrained by a dam that towers over the southern plains of Casai.

## History

The Mt. Ebonfire region was most likely included within the [[First Tharhan Empire]]. When the empire dissolved, the region came under the rule of the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms|Tharhan kingdom]] of Dehar. Dehar profited greatly from its mining industry and uniquely strong steel, unable to be replicated by any other civilization's smiths. Parts of the region were possibly settled by and placed under the rule of the [[Casain Empire]].

After the [[War of Unification]], Dehar was vanquished and its lands were absorbed into the [[Second Tharhan Empire]]. In the late Second Avihm, Mt. Ebonfire was annexed by the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]], as Tharhan and Casai, being intimidated, joined them. The region was grouped into House Vera's jurisdiction, along with the Veldt.

After the empire's sudden [[Fall of Avsohm|collapse]], Mt. Ebonfire was a target in [[Maelihs|Maelihs's]] conquests due to its mineral wealth, although it is not entirely clear if his [[Empire of Maelihs|empire]] extended that far at the time.

If the region was subjected by Maelihs, it was seized by the [[Insohm|Insohmic Coalition]] during the [[Battle for Drehmal]] and probably allotted to one or more member states. With the crumbling of the Order of Insohm at the end of the Third Avihm, Mt. Ebonfire once again fell under Maelihs's control. The residents of the town of Ebonrun on the northern side of the region, which currently marks the edge of Maelihs's empire, are enslaved as miners to extract the region's precious resources. Plots of rebellion are sprouting among Ebonrun's people, as they hope to break free from Mael's hold.

> The Mt. Ebonfire tower.

The Mt. Ebonfire region's [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is located northeast of Mt. Ebonfire itself, on the bank of the waterway surrounding the volcano. A wooden bridge leads from the top of a nearby ridge to a wooden platform circling the tower on its upper half. Its base is guarded by "Undead Miner" zombies.

## Points of Interest

### Ebonrun

[[Ebonrun]] is a small town in the region's north, sitting on land elevated above Casai to the south. Between the town and lower plains lies a reservoir and dam. Its buildings are small and crudely shaped, and built from slate, gray concrete, stone, and wood (oak, spruce, and dark oak). The local Tharhan people are currently ruled over and enslaved by Maelihs and made to work in the region's nearby mines. Many are keen to stage a resistance.

### Flammer Mines

A mineshaft in the southwestern face of Mt. Ebonfire leads to a series of caves. The cave to the right, overtaken by cave spiders, is home to the [[Flammer]] legendary.

### Lailoehn Temple

In the far west of the region, a slate brick temple is dedicated to [[Lailoehn]], Aspect of Fire. It holds the [[Artifacts#Sparkstoker|Sparkstoker]] artifact, a small statue of the Aspect himself, and a [[Runic Catalyst]].

## Extras

Mael suggests in the [[Archaic Transcript]] book that Mt. Ebonfire was not always this desolate, as he refers to an event as the "scarring of Mt. Ebonfire", having occurred during his and [[Drehmal]]'s lifetime. This does not appear to be referenced anywhere else.
