> Due to transportation difficulties involved with such delicate instruments, primal catalysts began to be inscribed out of imported rehntite on Lo’Dahr itself.
>
> The very low temperature has proven so ideal for inscription that there are plans to use this facility for all the most complex primal catalysts needed for the empire.
