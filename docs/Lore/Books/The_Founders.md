### Transcription:
> In the beginning, there were three.
>
> First came Tehra. She was beautiful, proud, and nearly as knowledgeable as an Aspect herself. Friend of Moen and mother of many, she came to lead the first and ruling faction, the Scalebound.
>
> Second came Sereven. He was kind and clever, and wise beyond his years. Friend to Nahyn and artist without compare, he came to lead the second and peacekeeping faction, the Talon.
>
> Third came Froslea. She was warm and funny, with ample confidence and a smile that shone brighter than the Torahn. Friend to Rihalae and renowned storyteller, she came to lead the third and recruiting faction, the Wingmakers.
