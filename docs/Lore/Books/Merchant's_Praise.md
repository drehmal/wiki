This book can be found in a chest in northeastern [[Av'Sal]], written by a merchant happy that [[Anyr]] has brought Avsohm out of an economic recession.

## Transcription
> A new shipment of exotics just arrived. Melons from the Black Jungle, perfume from Akhlo'Rohma, and even live quail from Casai. Anyr says it's part of his new economic plan, after the recession under Ifeihl. The Empire hasn't fared this well since the reign of Drehn!
