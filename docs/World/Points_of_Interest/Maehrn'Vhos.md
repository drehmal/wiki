![[maehrnvhos.png]]

**Maehrn'Vhos** is a massive wall built at the far northwestern edge of the [[Ebony Veldt]], initially built to repel invaders from [[Casai]] and [[Merijool]] in the north. Today, it is inhabited by [[Mihkmari]] pillagers.

Maehrn'Vhos can be accessed from roads to its north and south: from the north, the road between Merijool and Casai forks off to towards the wall, and to the south, the road trails off into the Ebony Veldt.

## Contents

The entirety of the content at Maehrn'Vhos is located on top of the wall, guarded by Mihkmari. At the eastern end of the wall is a cage, containing a Grafted Mihkmari (Ravager). The western end of the wall is home to another fenced-in area, containing the [[Tale of Maehrn'Vhos]] book and the [[Artifacts#Sword of Artohris|Sword of Artohris]] artifact.

## Lore

Maehrn'Vhos seems to have been constructed by the [[First Tharhan Empire]] or one of the [[Six Tharhan Kingdoms]] in mid-Av2, with the goal of repelling invaders from the [[Casain Empire]]. 

There are conflicting accounts on how successful the wall was at turning the invaders away. [[Tharhan A Land of Conquest (Chapter 2)|Tharhan: A Land of Conquest (Chapter 2)]] suggests that the Casains initially made it past the wall, but were slowly pushed back by Tharhan's forces, and were able to circumvent the wall by landing on the western coast of [[Anyr'Nogur]] and advancing inland. This invasion was only repelled when the forces of [[Caer Adacia]] rose from underground to cut the Casains off.

Maehrn'Vhos is also said to have prevented an attack by forces from Merijool later.

The wall has likely been occupied by Mihkmari forces since the collapse of [[Insohm]].
