## Transcription
> With the new taxes Mael's generals have put onto us, we need to grow our mining operations... quickly. So, I've scouted out a new, previously untapped mining location - and it's not too far from here!
>
> Simply follow the roads to the east - towards Merijool.
>
> Once you find a small river, hop on a boat and travel north. You'll be going through the sea between Casai and Merijool for a bit, but at the northern end is a volcanic island littered with dead trees.
>
> I did see a plume of smoke rising from the northern side of the island, however. Maybe someone already lives there? We'll have to check before we start any sort of operation.
