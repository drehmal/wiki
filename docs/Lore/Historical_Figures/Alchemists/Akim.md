# Akim

**Akim** (pronounced "ah-keem"), Lord of Dust, was an alchemist who is believed to be the second [[Drehmari]] to ever complete the [[Alchemy#Great Work|Great Work]], after [[Aok]]. He (1) is mentioned only twice on the map, with one original writing of his being found at [[Teiruun Monastery]].

1. Akim's gender is not confirmed by any in-game source, but due to the title "Lord of Dust", this article refers to him as masculine.

Akim is referenced in a book at the [[Nimahj Alchemy Fortress]], not by name, but by his title of "Lord of Dust". Akim is referred to here as one of two alchemists to ever complete the Great Work.

Akim's much longer reference is a book that is written by this character, the [[Dusty Tome]]. Within, Akim asserts that he has completed the Great Work, ascending to the fifth Sphere, but has seen a previously hidden sixth sphere in his dreams, with something whispering to him to reach out and grab it. This book is one of the only in-map mentions of the [[Alchemy#Ambition|Ambition]].

Akim's powers and history are not well understood beyond these two sources.
