## Lore

Dusps, or the painted city, is very wealthy and commercial, and the largest township in modern Drehmal with impressive architecture and culture. However, this isn't without a dark past. Following the fall of Avsohm many immigrants from [[Casai]] came to Aklo'Rohma seeking asylum. However, with the fall of Avsohm came the rise of Ancehl and his dominion, and with it, severe xenophobia. This created tension between the citizens of Aklo'Rohma and Cassai until the Dohval civil war, which ended with the fall of the dominion and the formation of the kingdom of Dusps, featuring virtues of peace and kindness.
