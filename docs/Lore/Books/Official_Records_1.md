### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in [[Thesund]]. It establishes that this village was established by the children of Avsohmic citizens shortly after the fall of the empire, who were attempting to distance themselves from their past and the perceived sins of their ancestors for bringing about the fall of Avsohm.

### Transcription:
> We call ourselves the Republic of Drehmal. We have seven sixteen year-olds, one seventeen year old, and ten fifteen-year-olds in our ranks. I’m the only fourteen-year-old on the Grand Council, and you had better believe that I’m proud of it. We're survivors, but we’re also pretty strong in our own right. When we aren’t hunting for food, we do our best to help the little kids.
>
> The rest of the council wasn’t sure that we should keep records in case the hole monsters come back, but my dad always used to tell me about the old prophet Shirua’s teachings and how important it is to write everything down. I promised the “elders” that I wouldn’t record anything about science or technology or venture anywhere near any Avsohmic ruins.
>
> That's also why we all decided to live so far away from anything made by our cursed parents. People survived before primal catalysts. Maybe not easily, but they survived. We’ve made some wooden and stone tools, and they seem to be doing the trick. Evvie is even trying to make a little farm by the creek. One thing’s for sure, this won’t be the last you hear of Jorgo. We’ll find a way to be happy here, somehow.
