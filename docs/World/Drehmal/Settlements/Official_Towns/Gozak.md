# Gozak

![[Gozak1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Gozak** is a town in the [[North Heartwood]], near the eastern edge of the region. It is accessible through a partially-intact path that runs from [[Capital Valley]] through a clearing in the North Heartwood, which also continues east to the [[Verdant Labyrinth]], connecting to [[Spearhead Forest]] and the [[Black Jungle]]. Gozak is a very common second town for players to discover, due to its proximity to the [Central Regions](/World/Drehmal/Regions/Central_Regions/).

!!! abstract "Location"
	Approximate Coordinates: `2276, 57, 2526`

Gozak is relatively small, comprising only about 10 buildings in a ring around the central marketplace. The village is partially surrounded by what appears to be an artificial moat, connected via land to the south to the nearby road. These buildings are primarily made of quartz, with wooden roofs and stone brick foundations.

Entering Gozak for the first time grants the "People of the Heartwood" advancement.

### Market Plaza

In the center of town, three merchant stalls can be found, with permanent custom villagers that offer unique trades.

### The Leafbowl Tavern

The Leafbowl Tavern is Gozak's inn, located in the southwest of the town (first building on the left). The Primal Cache room is located upstairs.

### Drehmal Statue

A statue of [[Drehmal]], very similar to the one found in [[Drabyel]], is located at the entrance to the village, with a sign that reads "GIFTS TO DREHMAL, DEITY OF PRESERVATION". A milk bucket is placed at its base.

### Western Buildings

Gihmli's Workshop, a building to the west, contains a wheat mill, and a neighboring building holds the [[Pillager Report]] book, which hints at the location of [[Castle Scarstone]]. 

### Whiteroot Forge

Whiteroot Forge is a building in northwest Gozak, home to the town's Runic Blacksmith. A building just east of it holds the "[[The Hunting of Greatbeast Muhs]]" lore book, which tells the tale of the death of [[Muhs]], Aspect of Beasts, at the hands of a Hunting Party in late Av2.

### Kozdro's Melon Mania

A building in eastern Gozak, Kozdro's Melon Mania is home to the Melon Merchant, as well as a massive melon. Digging into the large melon will reveal a sign that reads: <br>
> You monster. How dare you destroy me.

## Lore

Gozak was a historically powerful force in the Heartwood, acting as guardians of the forest and heading the [[Gozaki Union]]. Much of the area's political history is defined by conflict with the inhabitants of the nearby [[Black Jungle]], particularly the [[Tidal Dynasty]], as well as its membership in larger political bodies, such as [[Avsohm]] and [[Insohm]]. 

The desolation of the [[South Heartwood]] in Av3 was a crippling blow to Gozak as a political force, greatly reducing their sphere of influence and leading its remaining inhabitants to become more reclusive, hiding in the forest rather than guarding it.

## Extras

### Soundtrack

Gozak's theme song is "Heart of the Forest", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
