### Transcription:
> Poor Duchess doesn't know what hit her. Such a sweet girl doesnt deserve to be thrust into politics so young. You just can't be prepared for how cutthroat it is. Hard to say if handing so much power to the Regent was wise; on one hand, she can relax a bit... but on the other, who knows what that nasty git will do with even more control. Ol' Duruis wasn't a good person, by any means, but he was no Ehzar. Virtuo help us all.
