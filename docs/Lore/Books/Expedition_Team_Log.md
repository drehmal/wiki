## Transcription
> Report #1
>
> After a several month long journey across the eastern ocean, we arrived at our destination. The fog was thick and the seas were warped. A few hours before our landing, we saw the twisting, dreamlike cliffs that dominated the horizon. We set up shelter and dedicated the rest of the day to fortifying it from any potential hostiles.
>
> Report #2
>
> The second day was uneventful as the onyx-fog set in. We further reinforced the settlement, but had yet to encounter any living entities.
>
> The next day, the sky cleared and towards the north, we saw it - the great Bright Capital as told in ancient scripture. Tall lucent spires pierced the sky with impossible bridges connecting them. Some were shattered, others were tilted, one massive structure was half submerged. At the base of the towers you could make out the layered city, which also seemed to be somewhat underwater. We immediately planned out our expedition to this legendary city.
>
> Report #3
>
> Another day passed and the scenery had changed while on our journey. The cliffs dissipated and what was left were vast branded plains, which we could only assume was farmland. There were large clouds with strange, leg-like protrusions that extended all the way to the ground, almost like a giant, lofty spider.
>
> Report #4
>
> Further we went as the Torahn rose yet again, slowly approaching the city. As we neared it, more details became visible - great chains that stretched through the sky, some reaching to places unknown. We saw a floating tower that rested in the sky, parallel to the horizon. Through the thin alleys between the towers we could make out something at its center. Something that emitted an ominous black light.
>
> Report #5
>
> I am writing this final report with regret. Only 4 of the 15 original expedition team survived the encounter. Inverse black orbs from across the split hills came straight for us, consuming all that they touched. We’re lucky that we were able to make it to the shore and our ship alive. Luckily, we have more than enough supplies for the trip back, but morale is low.
>
> Note from commander - The eastern expedition has been cancelled and we are relocating to a new site in the west. The new launch zone will be prepared and ready whenever Anyr orders it.
>
> Unfortunately, he’s invested in other projects right now.
