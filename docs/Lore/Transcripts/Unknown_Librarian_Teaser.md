No clear explanation for the Unknown Librarian's identity or the meaning behind this series of messages has been given.

> Ah.
>
> Now isn’t this a surprise!
>
> I know you can hear me, somewhere in there.
>
> We’ll need to catch up soon, you and I!
>
> I know all about you, of course. But nothing can substitute for a primary source.
>
> If you knew the reason for my interview, you would probably think it was pointless. And who could blame you?
>
> A task that’s often labeled as “pointless” is counting all the grains of sand in a beach. A task that no mortal could hope to finish.
>
> Even if one did have the time, it would be nearly impossible. By the time you finish counting the grains once, the beach will doubtlessly be battered by waves into even finer grains. New pebbles will be caught by the tide and brought from the seafloor to be broken on the shore.
>
> As long as the waves churn, the grains will never consent.
>
> So why do I do this? Why do I count the grains? Why must I know the journey of every soul given flesh?
>
> Call it a compulsion. Call it simple curiosity.
>
> Whatever the truth, it grounds me. I slip between the tapestry’s warp and weft. As I count, the grains flow gracefully around me like minnows in the open sea. I greedily read every word in the library, one letter at a time.
>
> But I forget myself. Allegory is not the domain of the historian. I am only here to watch and listen.
>
> Before long, you will return to your own senses and your own tasks. I wonder why you will do what you do.
>
> A sense of duty? An enduring dream? A moral compass? Emotion or logic? Ideals or pragmatism?
>
> Whenever you have your answer, I won’t be far away. I await your discoveries with bated breath.
>
> Good luck, sleepyhead.
