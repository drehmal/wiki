## Transcription
> During a recent trip to see the white flowers of north Akhlo'Rohma, we took a leisurely lunch by the riverside. Suddenly, just as I was finishing my redberry sandwich, one of our mules ran off the path with most of our supplies, so we gave chase after it.
>
> We didn't find the fella, but we did almost stumble into a cave that wasn't marked on our map with some strange worn quartz pillars.
>
> Pehra immediately called a halt to the group. Identifying the pillars as Avsohmic, she told us to go on and search a bit more for the mule while she stayed behind for a while. Jemf had all of our scales, so this was fine for the rest of us. When we finally found him and came back, Pehra told us that we may have made a major discovery!
>
> I have the directions written down so that we can make a return journey soon:
>
> Travel west along the great river that begins at the Veruhkt Plateau, cutting through Akhlo'Rohma. On the northern side of the river, where the white flowers grow, are gray peaks that protect Akhlo'Rohma from the blizzards of Faehrcyle. Right before the river meets the ocean are two valleys that touch the gray mountains. The valley with the colored cliffs on its eastern side is the one with the cave, at the base of the mountains.
