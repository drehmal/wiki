## Transcription
> Great Maen, in your glory as a conqueror, in your terror as our patron deity, let my voice be heard! I call upon you to inflict pain upon our enemies, and may we be your torturous implements! Those doddering fools who worship Moen will rue the day they decided to be born, mark my words!
