# Av'Sal Repository Entries

!!! warning "While the Repository itself is considered an early-game discovery, there are repository articles that pertain to areas throughout the game, including spoilers from the entire storyline."

!!! warning "Be very cautious of spoilers on individual pages, as denoted by their SPECIFIC spoiler messages."

This section contains twelve pages, for the 24 holotexts found as part of the [[Av'Sal Repository]].

Each page is home to two holotexts: the incomplete version of the entry, which appears if the player has found some but not all of the location's holotexts, and the complete version, which displays when all holotexts in the area are found.
