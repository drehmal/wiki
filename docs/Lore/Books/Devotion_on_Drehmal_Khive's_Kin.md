## Transcription
> Mystic Elder Khive has not maintained much of a presence outside of Lo'Dahr since the Felling, but he must have gone somewhere when the Divine Schism consumed the other Aspects. Rumor among Drehmari rune-hunters has it on good authority that he took shelter in an old decaying town along the banks of the Noroehl River, which runs south from the lake outside the Primal Cavern. I'm not sure whether the hunters have found anything just yet, but it may be worth a visit.
