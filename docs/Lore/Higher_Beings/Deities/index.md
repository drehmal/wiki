# The Deities

In Drehmal, there are three higher beings whose status is above those of the Aspects, and they are known as Deities. These three figures—[[Drehmal]], [[Maelihs]], and [[Virtuo]]—were all born from some fragment of the [[Primal Tree]] upon its [[Felling|felling]] at the end of Av1, inheriting greater portions of the Tree's spirit and power than the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects) had. As such, they take different appearances than the Aspects, and have greater levels of power, although they are comparatively younger.

## Drehmal
[[Drehmal]] is the colossal serpentine creator deity of the realm, responsible for reshaping the land after the cataclysm that occurred at the end of Av1, making it inhabitable again. They retain a decently-sized following of worshipers, although they have been dormant for millennia by the time that the player emerges from stasis.

## Maelihs
[[Maelihs]] is the god of chaos, frequently portrayed as an antagonistic figure to the [[Drehmari]], the dominant humanoid race on Drehmal. His empire reigns over a significant portion of the western third of the continent, but he himself is nowhere to be found on [[Overworld|Drehmal]].

## Virtuo
[[Virtuo]] is the Goddess of Peace, Purity, and Perfection. For most of her life, she has been the most widely worshiped deity among the Drehmari, frequently preaching to them and waging protective wars against Mael. However, she abandoned the continent at the end of the Third Avihm, leaving a confused and sometimes spiteful populace in the [East](/World/Regions/Eastern_Regions/) (her traditional sphere of influence), and ushering in a new Avihm characterized by the abandonment of her many followers.
