# Drabyel

![[drabyel_1.png]]

**Drabyel** (technically known as **New Drabyel**) is the official town of the [[Capital Valley]] region, located just south of the Capital Valley [[Terminus Network#Towers|Tower]]. The path that leads away from the [[Stasis Facility]], where the player first spawns, leads toward Drabyel, making this the first town found by most players.

!!! abstract "Location"
    Approximate Coordinates: `502, 67, 1801`

Drabyel is a relatively humble, small village, but can serve as an effective early-game base, with a central location, a modest amount of loot and farmland, and proximity to the ruins of [[Av'Sal]]. The village sits on the southern tip of a peninsula which juts into the Mouth of Drehmal, the inland sea in the center of the continent, from the north. 

The town is populated entirely by [[Drehmari]] who worship the serpentine creator deity [[Drehmal]]. Like all other official towns, Drabyel is home to an [[Adventuring Merchant]] and a [[Runic Blacksmith]].

Entering the town for the first time grants the "Children of Drehmal" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[drabyel_map.png]]{ width="400" } 
> The in-game map of Drabyel, found next to the village church.

Drabyel is a small, simple village, built mostly with oak and spruce wood. Houses are often partially built into the ground, reminiscent of hobbit holes, with most buildings having grass roofs.

### Stables

Immediately to the right on entry, Drabyel's stables hold two horses. The chestnut-colored, white spotted horse on the left is a relatively fast horse, and either one can be tamed and ridden by a player.

### Drehmal Statue

A statue of Drehmal is found in front of the farmhouse, with a sign that reads "GIFTS FOR DREHMAL, SHAPER-SERPENT" at its base, and a spore blossom placed in an invisible item frame.

### Farmhouse

In the southwest corner of the village, behind the same house that the Adventuring Merchant stands in front of, a sizable field is found growing wheat. About half of the terrain is not properly tilled, but this wheat can be harvested as an early-game food source, and some players may even wish to fix this small farm for food. 

The basement of this house is home to a [[Cat Maps|Cat Map]].

### Church of the Split Deities

The Church of the Split Deities is the only stone building in Drabyel, sitting in the south of the village. Signs along the sides of the building reference the three Deities—[[Drehmal]], [[Virtuo]], and [[Maelihs]], making it clear that the inhabitants of this village worship all three, hoping for the blessing of each god's positive traits.

At the top of the building, the [[Artifacts#Axe of Growth|Axe of Growth]] artifact is found behind a chiseled stone brick.

The graveyard to the east of the church contains six graves, all of which have some loot buried beneath them. Thornton's Plate, a named chainmail chestplate with the Thorns I and Unbreaking I enchantments, is found in the back corner, in a grave whose deprecated sign seemingly once read "Billy Bob Thornton".

### Smith's House

The blacksmith's house notably contains two different chests, each of which has a lore book. The first, titled [[The Rise of Avsohm]], describes how the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]] came to be, and the second, [[The Fall of Avsohm]], describes its later years and abrupt end.

### Nature's Rest Inn

Drabyel's inn is located east of the Runic Blacksmith. This building contains several Drehmari villagers, a smoker and some raw meats, and four guest rooms. Room #4, on the top floor, contains the inn's Primal Cache (Ender Chest).

### Drabyel Bookstore

The Drabyel Bookstore is a small building in the far east of the village, which contains three very important lore books: the Theogony series. These books are textbooks (not actual textbook length) which give an overview of the realm's [Higher Beings](/Lore/Higher_Beings/). [[Theogony Volume I]] describes the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/), [[Theogony Volume II]] describes the eight [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/), and [[Theogony Volume III]] describes the remaining [Minor Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Minor_Aspects/).

## Lore

This village is referred to as "New Drabyel" because it is the second iteration of a town by that name, with the former having been lost to time. "Old" Drabyel was a powerful city in the Second Avihm, and the original capital of the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]] under [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]]. Drehn, however, considered Drabyel too corrupt and overcrowded, and ordered the construction of the new capital of [[Av'Sal]], located just west of modern-day New Drabyel. The old town was lost at some point between the construction of Av'Sal and the modern day, and is not believed to exist anywhere on the map—even as a ruin.

It is unclear exactly when New Drabyel was founded, or if it is in the same location as the former city, but it remains one of the only centers of civilization in Dreh'Noha.

## Extras

### Soundtrack

Drabyel's theme song is "One Day's Journey," by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
