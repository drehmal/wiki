Though incredibly rare, it has potentia equivalent to the strongest souls. This armor was forged from rehntite in a mine at its largest known reserve. Its location was lost after Avsohm's fall. |

## Gameplay
Rehntite Plate Mail is an NBT-modified netherite chestplate, inheriting that item's durability.

Rehntite Plate Mail is an absurdly strong defensive item, granting the player total knockback resistance, +10 armor, +5 armor toughness, and a whopping +20 max health, effectively doubling the base player health of 20 (10 Hearts). However, this comes at the cost of significant offensive penalties, halving the player's movement speed, attack damage, and attack speed.

The item's special ability, Catalytic Savior, activates when the player is hit by an enemy attack and their health dips below 20%. This effect creates a large explosion around the player, damaging and knocking back any enemies in the attack's range. (1)

The chestplate's abilities and penalties make it very challenging to use all the time, but it can be extremely effective within combat encounters where the player does not need high movement speed.

## How to Obtain
The chestplate is located in the [[Rehntite Cave]], within the mountain range that runs west-east and separates [[Akhlo'Rohma]] from [[Faehrcyle]].

Approaching from the south, the entrance to the cave is found along the western portion of the Akhlo'Rohma side of the mountain range, marked by a few damaged quartz pillars. The cave opens into a large cavern, with a single path leading to a large domed building. The item is found in a trapped chest on top of this building, which can be accessed via an elevator inside.

## Lore
[[Rehntite]] is the inanimate material with the highest known potentia (intrinsic magical power) in the realm of Drehmal, and was one of the early discoveries that allowed [[Avsohm]] to make extremely rapid technological progress. The material was used to make runic catalysts and powered much of the empire's more advanced technology, and the cave where this item is found was the empire's single largest source of the mineral. This chestplate is made out of rehntite, explaining its clear superiority over other legendary pieces of armor in terms of raw strength.
