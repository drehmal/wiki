> One of the great tragedies of the Avsohmic age was the obliteration and looting of the Tinaxi Pools ziggurat of the eastern Veruhkt Plateau. Though much of their unique technology is now lost, we know from a few inscriptions recovered from the nearby ruins of Sal'Veruhkt by Dusps in early Av3 that this temple was once home to ingenious designs which rivaled the complexity of Avsohm's. Someday, maybe, I will make an expedition up there to see it for myself!
