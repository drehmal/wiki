 

This book can be found in a chest in the ruins of Rhaverik in the [[North Heartwood]]. From it, we learn that Rhaverik was a mining town, and was warned not to continue mining for rehntite by a traveling witch. They refused to heed this warning, and most of the town was lost to a colossal sinkhole.

> I can't believe it. The witch was right. Over twenty confirmed dead in the mines, and ten more still missing.
>
> I was sure that when she and her tribe came to town, they meant nothing but harm to us. For as long as my father could remember, they have come to Rhaverik only to denounce our practices. Endless calls to stop cutting lumber, stop burning wood, and especially to stop keeping livestock have a way of undermining one's goodwill. When she suggested that we stop mining, I damn near drew my blade.
>
> But now, I don't know what to think. The haul was never as Insohm's top surveyors hoped. The Hovadchear Vein was thick but shallow, and while the Coalition Seam continued for some distance, it was thin and full of mostly impure rehntite.
>
> All of these complaints are meaningless now.
>
> I will never forget the horrible creaking sound. It echoed from somewhere deep below, a sound that no stone should make.
>
> And then a deep rumbling, crashing, and shattering. Buildings slumped and collapsed, falling into the ground. The lake roiled and sunk into the holes we had dug. I will never forget those screams.
>
> Most have already moved on, now. Packed up and went away. I can't say I blame them, but my place is here. When the traders and travelers stay at the inn which used to be the hub of our community, I will tell them what happened to the town of Rhaverik.
>
> Folks have gotta learn to use their eyes and ears instead of just obeying commands from leaders across the damn continent. Greed is a force that can only be beat by stopping and thinking from time to time.
