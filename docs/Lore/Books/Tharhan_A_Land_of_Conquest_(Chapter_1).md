This book can be found on a lectern in [[Fort Nimahj]]. It is the first of four chapters, and tells the story of the First Tharhan Empire. Particular focus is given to their practices of shipping criminals away, sending felons south to [[Rhaveloth]] to be converted to [[Maelmari]] and misdemeanants north to the [[Ebony Veldt]], where they would go on to found [[Caer Adacia]].

## Transcription
> Tharhan: A Land of Conquest
> -------------------
> Though many outside the region are unaware, the name "Tharxax" is actually a Maelmari bastardization of "Tharhan", the name of two ancient Drehmari empires which thrived in western Drehmal.
>
> These volumes tell their story.
>
> The First Tharhan Empire was one of the most ancient civilizations to arise in Av2. Though very little could be gleaned from the few artifacts found by Avsohmic archaeologists on-site at the First Tharhan capitol of Elthun (modern-day Tharxax City), the Av3 discovery of the Patheraad unveiled the story of a surprisingly advanced society.
>
> It all began along the river Salah. Early tribes of survivors were drawn to the land as one of the first habitable places created by the Serpent in the west, and they immediately began irrigation and agriculture. Though kings and lords grew to dominate the region, it would not be long until Tharhan was engulfed in the Deity War.
>
> Legend has it that King Kathis was faced with a fateful decision: either bribe Maelihs by sending riches and peoples to the Burnt Lord in exchange for sending his armies east instead of north, or risk direct attack by the deity and his chaotic forces. Kathis chose the former. In return for civilians, supplies, currency, and resting places, the First Tharhan Empire would be spared.
>
> And thus, the Empire took on a decidedly Maelific flair. Under the Southern Code, felons and some misdemeanants would be punished by transportation. For felons, this meant a journey to Rhaveloth and conversion to Maelmari. But for the misdemeanants punished this way, it meant being blindfolded and brought north, to the faraway Ebony Veldt. This lesser punishment seemed to accomplish its goal, for none returned, and the prisoners were assumed dead to ravenous beasts.
>
> And yet, die they did not. Even as centuries went by and the First Tharhan Empire collapsed to internal strife, the prisoners and their descendants remained. Most settled underground in caves most beasts could not reach. The largest cavern became a town, and then a castle, and then a city.
>
> This underground sanctuary was known as Caer Adacia. It is from here that the history known as the Patheraad was written.
