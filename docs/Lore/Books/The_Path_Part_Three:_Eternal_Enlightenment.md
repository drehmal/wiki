### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest at a tower in [[Sahd]]. It is the last of three books comprising "The Path," and establishes the ultimate goal of this religion: To gain enough wisdom through the unique [[Drehmari]] ability to form complex memories and become like [[Mari]], The Laughing Dragon, having glimpsed the secrets that make the many cycles of the world function. It also recontextualizes the symbol of the salmon from the second book, as this fish is tattooed upon followers of The Path to represent the eternal struggle against the current to learn the inner machinations of the world.

### Transcription:
> As we have seen, us Drehmari are blessed with a keen power of memory. But we are also blessed with other powers in common with the other creatures: pain, pleasure, and fear.
>
> These three powers were granted by the Three: Maen, Moen, and Tethlaen and each can be channeled for good or for evil.
>
> Pain is a powerful motivator. While it can be used for evil to wage war or extract information from a prisoner, it can also be sought in order to strengthen one's body and makes the accomplishment of a goal all the sweeter.
>
> Pleasure, too, is a powerful motivator. While it can be used for evil by way of overindulgence, greed, or carnal acts and can distract from solemn duties, it can also bring happiness through laughter, excitement, friendship, and joint parenthood.
>
> Fear is a third powerful motivator. It can be used for evil when one succumbs to ennui or chooses to inflict it unwanted upon others through barbarism or xenophobia. However, it also does good by warning those in danger and saving life and limb.
>
> With our powerful memories, we can see the strengths and drawbacks of each powerful motivator. By harnessing them through thoughtful action and compromise, we can accomplish great things and accumulate what is known as wisdom.
>
> Perhaps the wisest individual in all of Sahd is Mari, the Laughing Dragon himself. By seeing all there was to see if the pain, pleasure, and fear of Drehmari in his travels throughout the realm, he managed to find such wisdom that he has managed to live entirely within the daytime of the world after glimpsing the arc of twilight.
>
> It is our duty to follow his example and find a way to become truly eternal. By achieving great wisdom, we can follow Mari's lead and forever continue our journey of discovery. Only then will we truly
begin to make progress along the Path of Enlightenment. One day, we too shall glimpse the arc of twilight and know all there is to know.
>
> This is why those of the Path emblazon ourselves with the insignia of a midair Vibrant Salmon. While the cycle will likely recycle most of our souls to be born anew, we seek, in this life or next, to forever move against the current until we can become like the Laughing Dragon.
>
> It is important to reiterate: to be taken for rebirth by the arc of twilight is not a failing. For those who have accumulated wisdom, that wisdom must remain in the soul of the newborn. By drawing upon it, it will be all the easier for them to stride confidently down the Path.
>
> Rather than being controlled by our pain, pleasure, and fear, we shall control ourselves with our uniquely keen memories. And perhaps, someday, we or our descendants shall reach the summit of the Seha highlands and see what lies beyond.
