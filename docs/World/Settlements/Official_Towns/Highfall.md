# Highfall

![[highfall.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Highfall** is a city along the eastern coast of the [[Highfall Tundra]] region. Accessed from the southwest via the main road that runs between [[Spearhead Forest]] in the south and the [[Veruhkt Plateau]] in the west, Highfall is the most northeastern settlement on Drehmal, and among the most isolated.

!!! abstract "Location"
	Approximate Coordinates: `5858, 65, -1068`

Highfall is a medium to large-sized town compared to the other official towns, taking up a significant amount of land, in three discrete zones. The main town is contained within the walls to the west, holding more commercial buildings, while the eastern outskirts are taken up by farmland. Highfall Castle towers over both to the northwest.

Highfall is built entirely upon a long island that runs west-east, and is connected to the main road by a bridge.

Entering Highfall for the first time grants the "Impoverished Nobles" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

> The in-game map of Highfall, near the city center.

Highfall can be divided into three areas as mentioned above. Throughout the two lower areas, there are several empty plots of land, potentially representing demolished buildings or failed attempts at growing crops.

### Stewards of Hope Adventurer's Guild

This building, in western Highfall near the city's main entrance, is the home of the town's Adventuring Merchant, as well as beds upstairs with a Primal Cache, in place of a proper inn.

### City Center

The Highfall City Center is home to three custom merchants, with a large pedestal in the middle of the town. This pedestal holds a pink tree, highly reminiscent of those found on [[Sahd]], although this one is withered, having been removed from its natural habitat long ago.

### Parish of Virtuo

The Parish of Virtuo, northwest of the city center, is the dedicated place of worship to the goddess [[Virtuo]] in Highfall. A back room contains the [[Priestess of Virtuo's Notes]] book, which expresses a Virtuo Priestess' discontent with being forced to worship the Lady of the Mirror, wishing instead to return to the [[Tethlaen]] worship of her northern ancestors, but lamenting that this will not happen under the current rule.

A statue of the Goddess is located next to the Parish, with a partially dilapidated sign that once read "OFFERINGS TO VIRTUO, LADY OF PERFECTION". A bell and a diamond are placed at its base.

### Nerves of Steel

Nerves of Steel is a blacksmith shop east of the city center, home to the area's Runic Blacksmith. A chest inside the building notably contains three diamonds.

### Highfall Library

The Highfall Library is located south of the city center, and contains three lore books: [[Islands of the Realm]], [[A Desperate Gambit]], and [[The Insohmic Civil War]].

### Chapel of Tethlaen

In the southeast of the walled portion of the city, the burnt Chapel of Tethlaen, whose signs are deprecated, can be found. It is heavily implied that this building was intentionally burnt down by Virtuo worshippers who considered worship of [[Tethlaen]], the Aspect of Fear, to be heretical, despite the fact that this practice was common among northerners. A custom merchant named the "Bone Dealer" stands at the back of the ruin.

### Heorot Hall

Far east of the walls, a larger building is found at the eastern edge of the island. A ring of custom named traders surrounds this structure, and while all have multiple trades, each trader has a trade for one specific item with lore text, creating a chain that the player can follow for a reward.

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    1. Purchase a *Charred Stirring Rod* from the "Woodcarver" beneath the red and yellow tent for 16 scales. <br>
	2. Trade the *Charred Stirring Rod* for an *Extra-Large "Crouton"* with Stewmaster Rej in the south. <br>
	3. Trade your *Extra-Large "Crouton"* to Ms. Kraht (northeast) for an *Untested Prototype*. <br>
	4. Exchange your *Untested Prototype* for a *Wax Commemorative Pickle* with the Pickling trader in the southwest. <br>
	5. Exchange your *Wax Commemorative Pickle* for an *Overcomplicated Green Dye* with the "Verna Waxler" trader in the north. <br>
	6. Give the *Overcomplicated Green Dye* to the Banner Legend (southwest) for a *Khras Mozohv's Symbol*. <br>
	7. Trade this banner for *The First Wheel* with "Carter", to the east. <br>
	8. Give your *First Wheel* to "Wise Sage Zalinaar" to the west for *Wisdom #2*. <br>
	9. Place the *Wisdom #2* chest and claim the piece of paper named "Practical Wisdom" inside, which reads: "When selling goods in a marketplace, maintain an attractive stand, and don't set up shop too far away from the other vendors!" <br>
	10. Take this piece of paper to the "Peddler", who has set up shop about 40 blocks south of the rest of the vendors. Exchange the wisdom for a celestial chondrule, your final reward.

### Highfall Castle

Highfall Castle, on a hill to the northwest of the rest of the city, is a large structure containing a significant amount of loot, but it is most notable for the questline that it begins. In a cramped storage closet behind an iron door in the castle, an iron trapdoor leads down to a separate structure inside of an icy cavern. To the north, a pitch-black tunnel extends for hundreds of blocks, made entirely of black concrete. At the end of the tunnel is a compass, which leads to a cabin far to the north, starting the trail that will lead to a [[Oblivion|Mythical weapon]].

## Lore

Highfall was once a prosperous and powerful trading city along major routes, powerful enough to abstain from joining the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] at their peak. They continued to be wealthy throughout most of the third Avihm, joining the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] and being a powerful member state, but the lasting effects of the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] likely made trade steadily decline during the years leading up to Insohm's formation. By the time that the Order disbanded, Highfall seems to have fallen completely into poverty, with once noble families forced to farm the tundra to survive. Today, Highfall is very minimally relevant outside of its immediate surroundings.

Residents of Highfall seem to have often been considered—both by themselves and by other civilizations—to be the northernmost advanced civilization, often leading to Highfall simply being called "the North", even though it is not the northernmost region on the continent. The peoples of [[Faehrcyle]] and the [[Frozen Bite]], primarily Faehrcylian tribes, were considered barbarians by most of the other societies on the continent, and Highfall is also believed to have taken several preventative measures, including building gatehouses and walls, to keep those true northerners out of their society.

Faehrcylian culture did find its way into Highfall, however, particularly through worship of [[Tethlaen]], the Aspect of Fear. Being a religious minority that worshipped an Aspect with a domain seen as strongly negative, Tethlaen worshippers experienced significant persecution outside of their native lands, similar to the discrimination faced by [[Casai|Casain]] followers of [[Voynahla]]. Faehrcylian natives likely made their way to Highfall en masse following the Frostfang Catastrophe, which made their home region almost completely uninhabitable, with Highfall being the nearest major settlement that they could flee to as refugees.

Tethlaen worship seems to have been accepted in Highfall for some time, as a Chapel of Tethlaen was built within the city, but it is burnt down today, likely indicating a malicious act of arson which may have also been accompanied by additional violence against Tethlaen's followers. This was almost certainly perpetrated by followers of [[Virtuo]], whose faith is imposed on Highfall, and it is also stated that there used to be [[Virmari]] rulers of Highfall, with the last Virmari king being assassinated by [[Blue Exodus]] during the reign of [[Drehn]], during Avsohm's rise.

## Extras

### Soundtrack

Highfall's theme is "Ashen Sky" by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.

### 2.1 Version

Highfall received a significant update in [[Drehmal v22|version 2.2]], including the removal of the [[Frozen Bite#Grimm Troupe|Grimm Troupe]] (now in the Frozen Bite), and the addition of more buildings in the eastern outskirts.

> Highfall as it appeared in Drehmal 2.1.

This change was made primarily by return_of_the_gamer (officially credited in the map as "Maelhrizz"), a prominent Drehmal community member.
