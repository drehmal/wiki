# Drehmal Community Events

Several semi-official organized events have taken place within the Drehmal community, overwhelmingly taking place on the [[Socials#Discord|Drehmal Discord]]. These have ranged from weeks-long build contests to server minigames.

## Events Team

During the [[Drehmal v21|version 2.1 era]], a formal "Events Team" was a part of the community. Made up of server moderators/regulars and Drehmal developers, this team arranged some events including customized Bedwars and similar PvP lobbies for the community. The Events Team was mostly active from 2021-2023, losing steam as some members became part of the official Drehmal dev team or moved on to other projects during the long wait for [[Drehmal v22|version 2.2]].

An event took place around the official release of 2.2 on April 5, 2024, in which players hunted for the player heads of all Drehmal developers, hidden throughout a 2.1 map.

## Advent Calendar

During the month of December every year since 2021, the Drehmal "Advent Calendar" event has taken place, run entirely by developer MoutonDemocrate. Drawing from traditional real-world Advent Calendars, this event begins every year with a simple map of Drehmal. Every day, server members are invited to make suggestions to alter the map somehow, and the 3-5 options with the most votes every day are implemented. These frequently lead to the map becoming near-unrecognizable after a few days, as the terrain is replaced with heavily dated references.

The final results from all Advent Calendars can be found below:

## Halloween Hide & Seek

Two of the largest events in the Drehmal community have been Halloween Hide & Seek activities, in which a build from the map is given an extensive spooky makeover and used for a Hide & Seek minigame in late October/early November.

In 2023, this event took place in a Halloween-ified version of the [[Kiln of Virtuo]]. A [custom song](https://youtu.be/ioJ3hOauTuQ?si=1nus-qh9P7ZfHaro) was created by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja for the event, which shows a screenshot of the build.

In 2025, the event was revived, with members of the dev team and server staff overhauling the town of [[Rihanar]] and surrounding islands to create a new Halloween town. The minigame was also expanded to include a mock "election" system and new power-ups for both Hiders and Seekers.

## Ruins and Remnants Build Contest

In December 2020, the Ruins and Remnants build contest was announced, as community members were encouraged to submit new ruins of their own on Drehmal v2.1 with the promise of the best ruins being incorporated in 2.2. Three builds were selected from the [final submissions](https://youtu.be/Aff9XZDNAFw?si=ftOnzJUO4OhY_fMR): and added to 2.2:

- 1st Place: [[Xor'Huul]] by Black Sabbath <br>
- 2nd Place: [[Loraga Keep]] by Pogoshark <br>
- 3rd Place: [[Sal'Lorahn]] by BurntGeneral
