# Muhs

**Muhs** (pronounced "moose") was the Aspect of Beasts, a giant beast responsible for the creation of all manner of other creatures. 

Muhs is one of four dead Aspects, having been slain by a mortal [[Hunting Party]] in late Av2, significantly increasing tensions between the Aspects and Drehmari, and contributing to the Aspects' decreased role on Drehmal. He is the only dead Aspect whose death was not part of the [[Divine Schism]].

## Description

![[muhs_ref.png]]
> Muhs' official reference image.

Muhs' passage in [[Theogony Volume III]] reads:

> Greatbeast Muhs, Aspect of Beasts
> ***
> Assisted Vayniklah in creating beasts. Was killed by the Hunting Party some time in Av2.

This passage once stated that Muhs was created by [[Vayniklah]] in order to help her create beasts, but this has since been changed. However, Vayniklah's top-tier [[relics|relic]] does state that she created the first Aspects in the second generation, and the family tree mural indicates that Muhs is one of these creations.

No detailed description of his physical form is given in-map, but small bits and pieces of Muhs' body are known from [[The Hunting of Greatbeast Muhs]]. He appears to have been a large, four-legged creature, described as having fur, paws, a snout, and a tail that he used as a weapon—overall a more mammalian dragon. Muhs' blood is also described as a deep green ichor.

### Color/Build Scheme

Muhs is typically associated with brown, green, and gray. Builds concerning Muhs are often lush caves or similar.

## Role

As the Father of Beasts, Muhs had a direct hand in the design and creation of most non-humanoid ([[Drehmari]]) creatures in the realm, including some more commonly referenced ones such as Grasswolves and Greybison. For this, Muhs was loved by some, as he created cattle and other animals that were beneficial or neutral to Drehmari, but he was also reviled by others, as some of his creations were hostile and predatory.

It is unclear if Muhs literally created every single creature in the realm, but he is shown to have the ability to create individual lifeforms from his own body.

## In-Map References

Muhs is sparingly mentioned aside from his death, but it is known from the "Tetrodotox" artisan item in [[Okeke]] that a Merijoolian tribe called the Obro worshipped him.

Muhs is known to have resided in the [[Underwood]], a lush den beneath the central [[North Heartwood|Heartwood]]. 

### Death

Muhs was tracked down and killed by the [[Hunting Party]] in Av2 1702, in the Underwood. A book in [[Gozak]], [[The Hunting of Greatbeast Muhs]], tells the full story of that encounter.

The Party was made up of a group of 7 mortals, six Drehmari and one [[Virmari]] [[arcanism|arcanist]], with motives ranging from vengeance to the pursuit of power and glory. This group was able to track Muhs to his den in the Underwood, and through a surprise attack, were able to mortally wound the Greatbeast. At the time of his death, Muhs split into seven Grasswolves, ferocious wolves that tore apart the members of the Hunting Party, except for the Tracker, who had already fled. The Tracker would be tried for deicide and hung in [[Av'Sal]] by the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]] for her act of deicide.

Muhs' death is said to have had a significant psychological impact on the surviving Aspects, convincing many that they should no longer spend any time at all among the Drehmari.
