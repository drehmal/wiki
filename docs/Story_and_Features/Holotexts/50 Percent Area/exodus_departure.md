## Transcription:
> Commander Verpyne personally invited me to join the **Aphelion** crew as their signal officer! To work aboard the crown ship of Avsohm, it’s honestly a dream come true. Now I get to do what I joined Blue Exodus for! I’m supposed to join a shipment through the tunnel towards Sal’Anyr tomorrow, and then from there receive a briefing and transport to the ship. To behold her storied golden sails in person… I can’t wait!
