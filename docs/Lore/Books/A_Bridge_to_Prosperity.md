 

# A Bridge to Prosperity?

This book can be found in a chest in the ruins of the town of Espinor, in the [[South Heartwood]], at the western end of the ruined bridge between that region and the [[Black Jungle]]. Within, a merchant hopes that this newly built bridge will help them become wealthy by trading with the [[Tidal Dynasty]].

## Transcription
> To my surprise, the Avsohmic bridge didn't ruin Espinor after all. The Tidemari of Zovan haven't tried to take us over yet, and the amount of goods and capital flowing in might just make my wallet sing!
>
> Really, I don't know why I was worried. For a humble gold merchant like myself, Avsohm never fails to deliver. The new Governor of Espinor has even given me a cut of the taxes to establish new trade routes with the Tide Queen. I have already taken the liberty of keeping a small cut for myself.
>
> Perhaps, I will even use some of those funds to take a trip to the Kiln. I have heard that the Virmari that live there are incredibly hot. Maybe even Virtuo herself will fall for myâ€¦ monetary charms! :)
