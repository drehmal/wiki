## Transcription
> The warmth of Lai is simply pitiful, worthy of nothing but scorn. The foolish worm blathers about basic idiocies like "kindness" and "compassion"; does he not know the perils we face? Our hated enemy, that of the cold, encroaches every day. No. Only we blessed few see the true light, the light of the Torahn! Obviously! Lai cannot compete with the cruel heat of our sacred sphere. We have seen it, communed with it, and tested out mettle; we shall be victorious! The naive idiots back in Merijool who still trust in Lai shall rue the day they banished the Astorahnni!
