# Thresa Vera

**Thresa Vera** (pronounced "thress-uh vair-uh") was one of the highest-ranking officers in [[Avsohm]], being the acting Chief Science Officer (CSO) of the [[Avsohm#Department of Science|DoS]] at the time of the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's fall]]. She was in a relationship with [[Gohri Zed]], and was close friends with [[Baen Vehmil]].

Thresa is one of the members of the Stasis Eight, the eight characters that players can spawn as. Thresa is located in Pod 1.

## Description

A character description for Thresa from official promotion posts reads as follows:

> Thresa Vera, Avsohm’s Chief Science Officer, is a somewhat stoic, but highly intelligent, observant, and efficient woman. Despite her impassive demeanor she is quite-well liked for her organization skills and leadership qualities. Thresa had a collection of potted plants.

According to her official reference art above, Thresa stands at approximately 5 feet, 8 inches tall (~173 cm). She has a very pale complexion and light blonde hair, which gradually fades to black. She has a relatively long face and pronounced, sharp features. She wears a pendant bearing the Avsohmic [[Torahn]], and has golden rings at the end of her black horns.

## History

### Early Life

Thresa Vera's early life is chronicled in her own words through the book [[A Retrospective]], the longest lore book in the map. Thresa was born to the noble House Vera, who governed the [[Ebony Veldt]] and [[Mt. Ebonfire]] regions under the rule of [[Avsohm]]. She grew up in the lap of luxury, in one of the wealthiest families in [[Ifeihl]]'s Avsohm, but was forced to step into a leadership role at a very young age due to her father's ineptitude. Just before Thresa turned 17, her father died at a party celebrating the coronation of Emperor [[Anyr]], and she fully stepped into control of her noble house.

Disillusioned with life in the aristocracy, Thresa decided to go to [[Av'Sal]] University, where she would meet her eventual partner [[Gohri Zed]] and friend [[Baen Vehmil]]. She proved to be an extremely talented scientist, and graduated after only a year, landing a position in the Avsohmic Department of Science.

### DoS

Thresa would spend the rest of the empire's lifespan as a researcher at the DoS, rising up the ranks until eventually replacing [[Eleis]] as Chief Science Officer. As CSO, Thresa worked closely with Emperor Anyr and the empire's brightest minds, including other members of the Stasis Eight. She was particularly active at [[Sal'Mevir]] and the [[Admin Wing]], and collaborated with Gohri and Vehmil to create the [[Stasis Facility]]. Thresa also oversaw operations at the Resonant Eye alongside [[Orix Cehein]].

## Extras

The note about potted plants from Thresa's character promotion lines up with the fact that the [[admin_departure.md|Thresa's Departure]] holotext in the [[Admin Wing]] is found in a room with potted plants. It is likely that this was Thresa's office during the empire's reign.
