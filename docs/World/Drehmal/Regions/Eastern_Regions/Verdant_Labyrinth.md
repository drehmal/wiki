# Verdant Labyrinth

![[Verdant_Labyrinth.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Verdant Labyrinth** is a small region in southeastern [[Overworld|Drehmal]] that serves as an obstacle when crossing between the [[North Heartwood]], the [[Black Jungle]] and [[Spearhead Forest]]. Although the Verdant Labyrinth lacks a Terminus tower and is technically part of the Verdant Mountaian range, it has its own distinct environment and can be considered a separate region.

## Geography

The Verdant Labyrinth is made up of canyons with waterways and a network of winding, grassy paths, surrounded by cliffs and spires of gray striped stone. Some spruce trees are also scattered throughout the land. The Labyrinth has two gates: one stands at the end of a road from [[Gozak]], marking the border between a small plain to the west of the Labyrinth (but still part of the overall region) and the Labyrinth itself, and the other being at the end of a road from [[Firteid]], demarcating the boundary between the Verdant Labyrinth and the Black Jungle to the east. There is also a passageway cutting through the Verdant Mountains to Spearhead Forest in the north. At the end of this snowy mountain pass is the start of a road that leads to [[New Mossfield]].

There are no major settlements in the Verdant Labyrinth, however there is a significant presence of [[Mikhmari]] across the area.

## History

Some time in the Third Avihm, the hero Deigh the Dawnstrider united many of his fellow, oppressed Mihkmari and led them to the Verdant Labyrinth to gain security from [[Maelihs|Maelihs's]] armies. This clan continues to occupy the land until the present day.

### Mihkmari Fortress

Over the water in the center of the Verdant Labyrinth is a fortified tower, situated on a chunk of land suspended in the air by giant chains anchored to the cliffs on either side. The fortress houses many Mihkmari warriors and crossbowmen. It was likely built by Deigh's clan of Mihkmari upon settling in the area.
