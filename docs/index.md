# Welcome to the Official Drehmal: Apotheosis Wiki!

!!! warning "**Drehmal is heavily centered around exploration and discovery, driven by YOU, the player, and many extremely cool and important things are incredibly easy to spoil yourself on! The map is designed to be played without the use of outside resources, such as this wiki, which contains MASSIVE spoilers for EVERYTHING in the map.  We strongly recommend only using this wiki if you are looking for something in particular, or if you have completed the map yourself.**"

!!! tip "Scroll down on this page for an introduction to the wiki, including how to navigate the pages, some good starting points, and a CRITICAL primer on spoiler warnings!"

Drehmal: Apotheosis is a Minecraft survival-adventure map that boasts a massive, rich open world with an original storyline, many custom gameplay features, expansive lore, and more! The most recent version of Drehmal is [[Drehmal v22|v2.2.1: Apotheosis]], built for Minecraft Java Edition 1.20.1.

Our wiki is an effort to document Drehmal's wonders and provide a single centralized resource for help in navigating the map for new and experienced players alike. This project is spearheaded entirely by highly invested community members, in direct collaboration with the map's developers, helping us to be as thorough and comprehensive as possible.

## Spoilers, the Wiki, and You!
Drehmal is a fantastic experience, and while this wiki is here to help you navigate and learn more about it, we CANNOT stress enough that you should attempt to find things for yourself on this map! There are many huge moments in the map's story, incredible hidden areas, and progression-locked abilities that are cool to read about, but much more fun to discover on your own!

Drehmal is designed without the use of outside resources in mind, and can absolutely be completed that way! If this is your first playthrough (even if you've played an older version before but not 2.2), we recommend keeping your wiki use to a minimum. Due to the nature of some aspects of the map, it is nearly impossible for this wiki to be comprehensive without being a significant spoiler risk for new players. Even the names of some pages and folders could be considered a spoiler!

As such, this wiki has been (and will continue to be) thoroughly tagged with spoiler warnings. At the top of each page, look for any spoiler messages that look like this:

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

This message will typically be followed by another message or series of messages in the same format, which will tell you the point in the story that you are likely safe to read that page. Spoiler messages may also appear later in articles, if only part of an article is a spoiler.

!!! danger "Spoiler warnings typically appear in either this red text block..."

!!! warning "...or this yellow-orange one (which often denotes slightly less severe spoilers)."

If you find yourself still needing outside help but don't want to risk the spoilers present on this wiki, then the Discord is a fantastic alternative to directly ask questions to experienced and helpful community members.

## Navigating the Wiki
This wiki (like its subject matter) has a lot of content, but we're here to help you make sense of it!

At the top of your screen, you should see 6 main tabs besides the current one, which you can start at when navigating the wiki:

- Just want to browse a bit of everything? **[Overview](/Overview/)** provides a glossary of all tags on the wiki. <br>
- **[:material-help-box: Help :material-help-box:](/Help/):** Want to know what to expect, need some help setting up the map, or have a question you think might be common? Check out the [Help](/Help/) section, which is currently home to the [[Getting Started]] page to help you set up your world and get an idea for how to play Drehmal, as well as the [[FAQ]] page, which contains the answers to some frequently asked questions regarding what you can/can't do on a Drehmal save, the contents of this wiki, and some common gameplay questions. <br>
- **[:material-sword: Items :material-sword:](/Items/):** Looking for info on the many new items that Drehmal adds to the Minecraft experience? This is where you'll find all of the unique items that Drehmal has to offer. These range from [Legendary](/Items/Legendary_Items/) and [Mythical](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/) weapons—weapons with incredibly powerful stats, custom models, and custom abilities—to [[Relics]], off-hand items gained through the unique [[Devotion]] mechanic that boost player stats. <br>
- **[:fontawesome-solid-scroll: Lore :fontawesome-solid-scroll:](/Lore/):** Interested in the deeper intricacies of the map's rich history? [Lore](/Lore/) is your one-stop shop for all things beyond the main story! Here, you can find a thorough [[Timeline]], a [comprehensive list of every lore book](/Lore/Books/), information on the [gods of the realm](/Lore/Higher_Beings/), pages describing [major historical events](/Lore/Historical_Events/), and much more! <br>
- **[:fontawesome-solid-cat: Misc :fontawesome-solid-cat:](/Misc/)** is our spot for miscellaneous articles, those that just don't quite fit anywhere else or pertain to a little bit of everything. Confused as to what a certain block, item, or mob is under the Drehmal resource pack? Check out the [[Glossary]]! If you're looking to reminisce, [Versions](/Misc/Versions/) is where you'll find information about (and downloads for) older versions of the map. Or maybe you're hunting for all of the elusive easter egg [[Cat Maps]]? Have a look and see what oddities the map has to offer! <br>
- **[:material-snake: Story and Features :material-snake:](/Story_and_Features/):** Just finished the story, or a part of it, and want a refresher on what exactly just happened? Are you stuck on a particular puzzle at a main story location? [Story and Features](/Story_and_Features/) is where you can find pages related to the main story and core mechanics of Drehmal. This includes a [[Story Progression|summary of the story]], a list of all Drehmal's story-driving [holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/), a thorough description of the [[Devotion]] system, pages detailing the story beats, loose gameplay walkthroughs, and lore of the many [story locations](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/), and more! Just beware of spoilers... <br>
- **[:material-earth: World :material-earth:](/World/):** Lost in the expanse of the realm, or just want to read a bit about interesting locations? If it's a place you can visit in the map, and not a story location, you'll find it here! [World](/World/) is where you'll find pages relating to every part of the open world—that is, locations which are not explicitly part of the main story, including all [towns](/World/Settlements/) and non-story [points of interest](/World/Points_of_Interest/). [[Overworld|Drehmal (Location)]] is a great place to start if you're just looking to get an idea for how to start exploring the map, or how to navigate that section of the wiki. Also check out our [Drehmal Regions Overview](/World/Regions/), which contains a list of the world's regions! Region pages are intended to serve as a rough guide for exploration of an area, providing a list of major points of interest and giving you an idea for what to expect in that region. 

Navigating through these tabs is the cleanest way to use this wiki, but there is also a built-in search function! Just be aware, this search bar will reveal **all** matches for a term, including matches for early-game terms on very late-game articles. Therefore, it is recommended that you stay away from that feature if you are at all concerned about spoilers. For your protection, some extremely spoiler-heavy end-game articles do not appear in search results, but can be found from the [Story Locations](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/) folder if you have reached that point and want to read about them.
