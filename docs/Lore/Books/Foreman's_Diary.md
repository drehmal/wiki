This book can be found in a chest in a small tower in [[Taihgel's Domain]]. It seems to reference the discovery of a [[Runic Catalyst]].

## Transcription
> One of the sifters found something weird during their shift. Strange purple rock, warm to the touch. Well, most rocks around here are pretty warm, but this one is special. Just lookin' at it I get a tingly feeling in my spine. I've had my boys put it at the bottom of one of the bins set to be shipped to Naharja next. I'll intercept it on the way to the dye shop and claim the shiny prize for myself.
