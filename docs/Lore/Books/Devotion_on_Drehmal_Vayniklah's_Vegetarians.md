## Transcription
> On the southern banks of the Resting River, east of Ancehl Castle, lies a village of greenhouses called Marahza. In the center of town lies the Temple of the Bloom and Bough, the loveliest shrine built to honor Vayniklah anywhere on Drehmal. When I visited, the villagers were delighted to see me! They served me a salad that was full of multicolored vegetables that I had never heard of, and we sang folk tunes until the Torahn peeked over the horizon. It was a truly memorable night.
