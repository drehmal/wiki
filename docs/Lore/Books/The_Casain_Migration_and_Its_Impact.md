## Transcription
> Casai, a land far to the west, across the Gulf of Drehmal and beyond the autumnal Merijool Peninsula, faced a great crisis at the dawn of the Third Avihm when the Avsohmic Empire fell. Maelihs came to conquer everything from Lorahn'Kahl to Merijool. Many Casain, while dedicated to their homeland, planned an exodus before Maelihs could wreck havoc on their towns and cities. Though many doubted that Maelihs would be able to make his way all the way north to Casai, those thoughts were put to rest when the high stronghold of Sal'Anyr at the heart of Anyr'Nogur fell within a single day. Starting then, children of Casai began a great migration to the East. They spread across the land, but most came here - Akhlo'Rohma. Unfortunately for them, a new home meant a new set of written and unwritten rules to become acquainted with.
>
> The most significant unwritten rule was discrimination, as a sizable number of Akhlo'Rohmans viewed the Casain as cursed peoples who would bring the ruin of Avsohm to their land. Thus, for many decades, there was ongoing fighting between the Casain diaspora and their allies against the hatred of authority figures. This culminated in the Dohval Civil War, wherein the city of Ancehl was burnt to the ground. While Ancehl Castle was spared, Akhlo'Rohman royal families still agreed to come to the negotiating table with Casain leaders. Though no good compromise ends with the parties feeling fully satisfied, the two factions agreed upon a constitution which respected the rights and traditions of each.
>
> This was the foundation of the Kingdom of Dusps, and though Ancehl Castle remained the regional seat of power, the Casain gradually became more and more accepted in society.
