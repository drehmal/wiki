## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in [[Firteid]]. It celebrates the re-opening of the city's public baths, and hints at a celestial chondrule in the building.

## Transcription
> The grand re-opening of the Ladle was such a success. After some much-needed renovations, we are getting more guests than ever before. Public bathing has a rich tradition in this neck of the woods, and we are bringing it back! In the grand reopening, we also met some folks from out of town. For instance, an appreciative, red-headed stranger left an odd piece of metal as a tip which we stowed upstairs in the hidden room. I’ll send Lilah to stow it at the bank tomorrow.
