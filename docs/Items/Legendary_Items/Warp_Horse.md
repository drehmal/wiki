The **Warp Horse** set (officially titled the **X-35 Equine Augmentation Assembly**) is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Actually a set of two items, the Warp Horse legendary is a unique set of horse armor and receiver, which together allow the player to summon their horse to them at nearly any time. It is found at the [[Exodus Vault]], the location where the 50% completion event takes place.

## Gameplay
The Warp Horse armor is an NBT-modified piece of diamond horse armor. Being horse armor, it is unbreakable.

The armor provides a significant boost to all of the horse's stats. It adds 10 Max Health (5 Hearts), with horses having an average health value of about 22 (11 Hearts). It adds 0.1 Speed, which is a significant boost from any value in the horse's possible base range of 0.1125-0.3375 (0.225 on average). It also gives a Jump Strength boost of 0.1, which is a significant increase from the possible range of 0.4-1.0, adding approximately an extra half block of height clearance to the horse's jump. 

The armor is also enchanted with Feather Falling IV, making the horse that wears it capable of falling very high distances without dying.

Placing the armor onto a horse adds it to the Exodus database, allowing it to be recalled using the receiver.

The Warp Horse receiver is an NBT-modified warped fungus on a stick, which utilizes an in-game chat similar to the [[AvPOD]], but much simpler. Initially, the player must crouch and right-click to open the WarpHorse database and find the horse they put the armor onto. From here, the horse can be favorited and summoned with a simple right click.

The receiver only works if the area in front of the player is a flat surface, with at least a 3x3 block space for the horse to safely be spawned on. If this check is successful, then the horse appears inside a cylindrical column of particles.

A linked horse will be recalled if the player leaves its general area (a radius of ~65 blocks), making it effectively disappear, ready to be summoned again using the receiver.

## How to Obtain
The WarpHorse set is found together, in the [[Exodus Vault]]. 

At the western end of the vault's main hallway/hangar, there are two garages on either side of a large vault door. In the southern (left) garage, the player can find [[exodus_horse.md|a holotext]] describing the creation of the Warp Horse technology, as well as the items themselves in a trapped chest.

## Lore
The Warp Horse prototypes were developed by Naskiki, a [[Blue Exodus]] staffer at the Exodus Vault, as shown by the holotext they wrote. This holotext states that this was the very first use of alchemically enhanced animals in Avsohm's military.

## Extras

The Warp Horse armor does have a custom texture (shown here) in the Drehmal resource pack, but it is not implemented into the game itself.
