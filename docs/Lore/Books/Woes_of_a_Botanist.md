## Transcription
> Why, in the name of all that is holy, WHY are these idiots putting ORCHIDS in the SHADE??? Why are there FERNS in DIRECT SUNLIGHT?? WHO decided to plant CARROTS where they will get NO SUN????? Everywhere I go its just lilies of the valley in the sun, roses in the shade, azaleas in the sun, daisies in the shade! Does ANYONE on this damned chunk of land know ANYTHING about plants??? Absolute abuse of these poor little things, they cant decide where they are! You have to take care of them!

> Next someone's gonna tell me there are giant mushrooms in full sunlight growing on the moon.
