# Drehmari

**Drehmari** are the predominant humanoid race on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], appearing as normal humans with antlers and horns. Most Drehmari are represented by villagers with special skins in-game, however supposed hostile Drehmari are represented by other mobs.

## Anatomy and Physiology

Anatomically, Drehmari appear to be nearly identical to humans, with a few important distinctions. All Drehmari have some kind of bony protrusions on their head, varying in color and form, ranging between short, pointed horns and long, elegant antlers. Otherwise, Drehmari body sizes appear very similar to humans, with the Drehmari whose heights are known ranging from about 5'2" to 6'5" (~157 to 195 cm). One significant outlier, [[Homli Tahsgan]], is rumored to have been about eight feet tall. 

Drehmari skin tones are also known to vary between common human tones, although one Drehmari from [[Gozak]] is referred to as having green skin in a lore book (1).

1. This is likely a turn of phrase to indicate that the Gozaki was ill at the time, not indicative of naturally occurring green skin tones. See "[[Just Two Weeks...]]" for original context.

The single largest difference between Drehmari and human physiology is their lifespans. Natural Drehmari lifespans are typically well over 100 years, sometimes close to 200, although [[(REMOVED) Calendar of Drehmal#Extras|Drehmal's calendar system]] does call into question how comparable a year is to a real-life year.

## Origins

Drehmari were said to have been created by the [[Primal Tree]] at some point in the First Avihm, made to populate the original three continents of the [[disc]]. It appears that the Drehmari were the only humanoid race created by the Tree, and all other humanoid races were derived from Drehmari.

[[Mari]], the Aspect of Drehmari, did not actually create the Drehmari. Rather, he appears to serve as a god of Drehmari culture and spirituality, keeping their history and furthering their development. The term "Mari" is a [[Rihselch]] word roughly translating to "creation".

[[Drehmal]], while caring deeply for the Drehmari and considering them their people, is also not the original source of the Drehmari, although they are considered to be the patron deity of the race. Maelmari will sometimes use the term "snakespawn" as a pejorative for Drehmari as a result.

## Spread

Drehmari history is largely synonymous with the [[Timeline|overall history of the realm]], as they are directly involved in almost everything except for [[Tehrmari]] history and events purely between the gods. On Drehmal, the Drehmari dominate all civilization, with the exception of two Tehrmari settlements in [[Purity Peaks]] and [[Maelmari]] inhabiting the southwestern regions of [[The Carmine]] and the [[Hellcrags]].

## Ascension/Differentiation

Drehmari can be converted into almost any other known humanoid race, primarily through the direct intervention of a [Deity](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/) or [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/).

[[Virmari]] are the ascended of [[Virtuo]], who were personally made into the Goddess's perfect image after being selected for their character and faith to her.

[[Maelmari]] are twisted versions of Drehmari created by [[Maelihs]], converted en masse in cruel rituals at the [[Sepulchral Altar]] to serve in the Burnt Lord's empire.

[[Tehrmari]] appear to have originated as Drehmari who profoundly befriended particular Aspects, and were ascended to become dragon people. Very few remain on Drehmal by the time of the main story.

[[Mihkmari]] are hybrid offspring of Drehmari and Maelmari, who take a similar appearance to Drehmari but with grey skin.

Drehmari could also be ascended by other, specific Aspects, although there is no currently canon lore that describes this process besides the attempt of [[Xor'Huul]]'s people to become [[Koh|Kohmari]].

## In-Game Skins
