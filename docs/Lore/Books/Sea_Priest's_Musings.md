## Transcription
> On a foggy day, I invite in any captain that arrives in port for a drink and a prayer. They're either a fellow saltblood who knows to place an offering to Dahr **on the prow of their ship**, or they're a living corpse who needs every bit of help they can get from a priest like me. Either way, it's a good time.
