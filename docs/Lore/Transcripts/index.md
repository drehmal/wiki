# Dialogue Transcripts

In Drehmal, the player will sometimes be spoken to directly through the in-game chat by one or more entities. This is almost exclusively reserved for story encounters (and late-game story encounters at that), so be VERY mindful of spoilers in this section.

This directory contains all instances of such dialogue.

Outdated dialogue, which is no longer canon to the storyline or lore of Drehmal, can be found in the OBSOLETE folder.
