## Transcription
> There was a stranger at the bar last night. It was late, nearly midnight, and only one table of party-going Foundry laborers remained alongside the regulars. I was polishing the old Tharhan granite countertop, admiring my reflection and minding my business, when I noticed the tall
purple-hooded figure sitting quietly in the corner.
>
> And then I could look at nothing else. The noise of the patrons faded in my ears and all I could do was trace the fabric of the cloak, its rumpled folds and smooth lines, down and up again to the weapon the stranger carried, a scythe with a strange lustrous gleam. I opened my mouth to ask Tamus and the others if they had seen the stranger, but the words caught in my throat. There was just a sliver of beguiling shadow, though the cowl of the strangerâ€™s hood faced away from me. And then that shadow crept up my shins, uncomfortably up through my torso, and into the back of my neck. I locked up, and dread began to twist around my face to pry open my mouth, as if dozens of grimy fingers were forcing their way into my throat. I stood there, and my heart plummeted as the figure slowly began to rise to its feet. There was something so wrong, but so enticing about it. I imagined how it would feel to wear the purple cloak and feel it envelop me in soothing depths of endless sorrow.
>
> And then it disappeared. Light and life came rushing back. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I realized I was gasping for air, hunched over the bar and coughing. My cheeks were flushed, and my eyes were unfocused.
>
> Even now, that figure continues to haunt my thoughts, beguilingly familiar and yet unspeakably alien. An emissary of the empireâ€™s end.
