## Transcription
> Lo’Dahr is hallowed ground; do your best to respect what thine Elders have so graciously created for us to thrive within.
>
> Word of thine Elders prevails above all else.
>
> The life of a fellow Tehrmari is sacred; to take the life of a fellow is to greatly disrespect thine Elders.
>
> In their first years, Ascended Tehrmari are required to return to Drehmal and gather culture. Do good on the will of the Aspects during your time in the unhallowed world; protect the world and nature created there by the Aspects.
>
> You have ascended, but you must not forget your roots.
>
> Present yourself not as intimidating, but open and warm. Dress in vibrant color so that you may be recognized by all that may need aid.
>
> Respect the hierarchy. There will be those with more responsibility and trust than you, and they are to be trusted and respected.
>
> Rear your children in accordance with thine code of conduct.
