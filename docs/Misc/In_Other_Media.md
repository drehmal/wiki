# Drehmal in Other Media

***

Drehmal is featured in Episode 3 of "Games that Rock the World", a 2024 RokuTV documentary miniseries about the history of video games. Toward the end of the episode, Drehmal is used as an example of a fantasy world built entirely within a sandbox game with clips from an interview with co-creator Rift. Footage of lead developers Keeko100, Rift, and DomeMaster playing Dungeons & Dragons is also seen in this segment.

The series is free to watch at [this link](https://therokuchannel.roku.com/details/793efb00a33ba64bbcb44fa4981ca1a2/games-that-rock-the-world) in the United States.
