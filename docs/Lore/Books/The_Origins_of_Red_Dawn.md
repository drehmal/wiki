## Transcription
> Red Dawn is an ancient alchemical society, born out of a collective of what we would now call Asomatous alchemists. However, that term is nothing but a modern invention. To these pre-Dawn alchemists, the Doctrine of Spheres was the entire breadth of the field. The founding of Red Dawn represented the transition from loosely bound sects to an organized group of dedicated researchers. Staunchly rejecting the steadfast ethicists of the noble families of Ancehl, Red Dawn focused heavily on divining the true nature of reality by breaking matter down into constitute parts. Red Dawn alchemists, ever the pragmatists, quickly flocked to the burgeoning Avsohmic Empire for both funding and security. However, in the waning years of the empire, more and more alchemists fled the ranks of Red Dawn to join up with the Burnt God Maelihs. After the fall of Avsohm, those defectors were all that remained of a proud alchemical tradition.
