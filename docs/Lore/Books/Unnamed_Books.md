## Virmari

### Coordinates:
| **X** | **Y**| **Z** |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
|4473  |72   |-305  |

### Location/Summary:
This book can be found on a lectern in what looks to be a ruined chapel between the [[Grand Pike Canyon]] and [[Spearhead Forest]] regions, providing insight as to the process of ascension to the status of [[Virmari]].

### Transcription:
> Virtuo brought upon her wrath, channeling it towards the wretched Maelihs, fulfilling the will of the Drehmari. This was not enough to stop the God of Chaos, and so Virtuo sought help from the people that rose her up. The Virmari were then born of the Drehmari that wished to become closer to Virtuo. Many made a great pilgrimage to the Kiln of Virtuo in the Black Jungle to ascend beyond the form that they were given. But to become a Virmari was not so simple; the Goddess of Purity desired perfection, utter and complete absence of ill will. Those that Virtuo deemed suitable to become her most devoted patrons henceforth became the Virmari, angelic beings donned with crystalline antlers.
>
> Only a few hundred Virmari survived the conflicts with Maelihs. Many of them were those who never met the wrathful deity. May Maelihs be struck down, his evil calamity be taken from the realm, and the souls of his crimson armies be tortured.

## gaming 2

### Coordinates:
| **X** | **Y**| **Z** |
|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|
|-48 |106   |139  |

### Location/Summary:
Hidden in a secret room on [[The Aphelion]]'s lower level that is inaccessible to a player in adventure mode, gaming 2 is the long-awaited sequel to gaming. Daring, bold, highly emotionally charged, and infinitely more ambitious than its highly-touted predecessor from the library of the great Painted City of [[Dusps]]. 

The fullest extents of this text's meaning are not within the scope of this wiki, but it is sufficient to say that this book is among the most important, moving, and groundbreaking pieces of lore in the entirety of the Drehmal universe, if not the single most important. If anything could truly encapsulate the feeling of Apotheosis, summarizing this world not only through a thorough depiction of its rich story but also by communicating the emotions it intends to evoke as a work of art, it is this book.

### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in an alleyway in [[Naharja]]. It describes the setting off of fireworks on the Day of Patronage, from the perspective of a poor child.

### Transcription:
> The rich kids keep shooting off fireworks while the rest of us suffer in silence. It's rough enough to have to scrounge around for scraps to live, can't they let me have a good nights rest for Drehmal's sake
