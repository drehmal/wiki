## Transcription
> Then, just as it seemed that Casai had won, a surprise attack took center stage for the second time in as many days. The daughters of the forgotten rose from the earth; Caer Adacia had come to rescue the countrymen who had once condemned them!
>
> Though very bloody, the remaining conflict was swift. Cutting through rebellious Tharhan prince and Casain general alike, the Queen of the Night and her disciplined followers took advantage of the confusion to gain control of the entire plains in under a month.
>
> Then, sitting beneath a double eclipse upon a ceremonial throne atop the Erxsival Arch, Tiderra I was crowned Empress of the Second Tharhan Empire. That night, the capitol was moved to Caer Adacia, the six kingdoms were officially annexed, and the Treaty of One Moon was signed with Casai, ensuring that the desert people could keep the land of Anyr'Nogur in exchange for peace between the two empires and favorable trade policies.
>
> For nearly two centuries, the Second Tharhan Empire was the greatest state in all of Drehmal. By offering ambitious nobles from the lines of former kingdoms positions in her council and creating a modernized code of laws, including a powerful judiciary and bill of rights, Tiderra I brought peace to the West.
>
> In the reign of Tiderra II, peace was even extended between Tharhan and West Merijool. This alliance irked Casai, but proved to be an effective means of controlling the neighbors. For the first time, Caer Adacia even felt safe enough to spill onto the surface to meet the Torahn's rays.
>
> Though Empresses Canirah I and Tiderra III were also relatively effective monarchs, the good days for Tharhan weren't to last forever. Far away in the East, an heir to the Chosen Kingdom who had renounced his birthright but nonetheless found himself in command of a new state would make two discoveries that would change the world.
>
> The lost rehntite cave of Akhlo'Rohma and the anomalous Mt. Yavhlix were catalysts that allowed Avsohmic technology to develop at a dizzying pace. It was well into the reign of Tiderra III when her loyal Nightwalkers were first confronted by Drehn Mal'Sohm's forces, but it was clear that Tharhan had no hope of resistance. Very few arcanists, no matter how trained, could hope to win against a squadron of soldiers armed with energy rifles.
