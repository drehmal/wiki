This book can be found in a chest in a gatehouse on the road from [[Highfall Tundra]] to [[Faehrcyle]]. It is written by the [[Mihkmari]] inhabitants of the gatehouse, who were preparing to venture west into Faehrcyle in search of treasure.

> We found this old gatehouse which I assume was for keeping Frozen Bite barbarians out of Highfall. But if they are more barbarous than the people of Highfall, this thing won't last. Still, it will be a good resting point before we continue our travels.

> We haven't even gotten to the Bite yet, and we've been trapped in this ruin for days buried in snow and ice! We left early and have made good time from the southeast. But it turns out even our geographer, Terthe, can't track a wild Faehrcyle nor'easter. She rolls her eyes at us and says despite her "really" wantin to she cannot predict when the clouds are gonna piss. I just want to continue, damnit. I want to find out what's on the vast tundra of Faehrcyle, west beyond Homli's Muhs-howling Pass. Maybe Avsohmic ruins. Who knows.

> Day 27
   The blizzard has finally cleared and our food supplies are low, but Terthe says that a caldera in the Bite is filled with game. As long as we're able to make rudementary hunting tools, we'll be fine. Furthnehn, the youngest of the group, is beginning to doubt the mission. He wants to go back home to Mossfield where it's safer and not freezing cold. Poor kid. If only he understood how unexplored the vast northwestern snowy wastes are. Who knows what we could find out there? We could be rich!
