## Transcription
> I started to wonder whether it would ever happen. Only a couple years, I'd thought, living here in Morah, and then I'd be away.
>
> But months flew by, and years turned into decades. I met Karve. The kids came and left beyond the Arc. Karve followed. For two months I grieved.
>
> Only now, despite thirty long years teaching and writing about it, does Reda Aseh join the Path.
>
> Recently, it has become clear why most pilgrims are old. For most of my life I figured that it was because only the wise can appreciate the patterns that govern the world around us.
>
> But the truth is so much simpler: the only ones able to let go of all worldly attachments to pursue a goal with every fiber of their being are those with few attachments left at all.
>
> I asked great Mari whether he thought this showed a lack of character on my part, but he just smiled and warmly embraced me. As is his way, he didn't say much. But he did tell me the following words, which I will never forget:
>
> "Just like the moons, Drehmari follow cycles, Reda. That you have begun to grasp that isn't a flaw."
>
> Though he didn't say anything else, this was enough for me to make up my mind. I apologize to Qera, Bahb, and all of the others who brought me joy daily in this place. And most of all, I apologize to the children. We will never meet again, I expect. Whoever reads this, I encourage you to continue down the Path when the time is right!
>
> Never stop learning.
