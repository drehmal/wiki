# Drehmal: Primal Journey

!!! warning "This page is about an unofficial expansion, not canon content! It is only intended to acknowledge the existence of the expansion, not act as a source of information for it."

**Drehmal: Primal Journey** is an unofficial, fan-made, modded expansion for Drehmal 2.2. Created by developer tworoundcats (before being promoted to the dev team), this expansion was first launched in summer 2024 shortly before the 2.2.1 port, known at the time as the **"DLC"** or **"uDLC"**. It was rebranded to Drehmal: Primal Journey as part of its 3.0 update in September 2025.

This is NOT an official expansion, but it is still well-known within the Drehmal community. It is **HEAVILY DISCOURAGED for first-time players** due to its generally less serious tone and deviations from the base game's design philosophies, but it can be an enjoyable way to give the map replay value for players looking to return to the world of Drehmal, especially players looking for a significant extra challenge.

## Content

Primal Journey adds several new modded gameplay mechanics, including the Better Combat mod, a new enchanting system, trinket and ring slots, new modded currencies, backpacks, and tougher versions of open-field vanilla enemies. Primal Journey also adds new Mythical and Legendary gear in accordance with Drehmal's conventions, as well as a new, separate system for upgrading mythical weapons. Some villagers also serve as proper NPCs, giving the player explicit quests through dialogue, and existing weapons can be upgraded with new unique abilities.

The expansion's 3.0 update, released on September 2nd 2025, was worked on by multiple other developers, including the lead writer on this wiki. The 3.0 update is a full-scale overhaul of the expansion, including but not limited to a full rewrite of all player-facing text for better lore coherence, a new original dungeon, several brand new encounters and items, and new bosses.
