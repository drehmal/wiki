The **Inscription Complex** is one of five main story locations on the divine moon of [[Lo'Dahr]], located in the far southwest corner of the moon, in [[Loe's Domain]]. Originally used by [[Avsohm]] to mass produce inscribed [[Arcanism|runic]] catalysts locally on the moon, it stands defunct by the time of the main story, waiting to be repaired by the player.

Like the other two non-core facilities on Lo'Dahr, its primary purpose in the map is to teach the player a mechanic that can be applied to the main puzzle at the [[Core Facility]].

    | **X** | **Y** | **Z** |
    |:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
    | -1000   |  118   | 1064  |

    Within the Lo'Dahr dimension, these coordinates place the player on the lower level of the Inscription Complex.

## Story
After reaching the Core Facility, the player will likely find the map depicting the four main Avsohmic facilities on Lo'Dahr, one of which is the Inscription Complex. There is no correct or intended order to visit the other three facilities, as long as the player eventually learns the lessons from each one.

The player can find the Inscription Complex hanging from the roof of a large, icy cavern in Loe's Domain. Once inside, [holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/) provide some insight on the relationship between the different Avsohmic facilities on the moon, as well as the empire's relations with the native [[Tehrmari]].

In the factory portion of the complex, where mass inscription actually occurred, the player is given a strong hint toward the main puzzle mechanic of the facility.

## Gameplay
Like the [[Resupply Depot]], the Inscription Complex was designed for airships to enter and leave, and as such, the player must find a way up to the building from the ground.

The main puzzle of the facility revolves around the inscription machinery, which requires player interaction in order to properly function again. This is very strongly hinted at by the [nearby holotext](inscription_factory.md).

??? question "Hint"
    The holotext mentions that a new lensing block is required every so often, and it has been a *very* long time since this was used, so it probably needs a new one entirely! Keep the size of Minecraft blocks in mind.

??? warning "Puzzle Solution"
    The puzzle can be solved, as suggested by the holotext, by replacing the diamond lens. This is done by placing a block of diamond on top of the small platform in front of the holotext, which will activate the factory and give the player a reward at the end of the assembly line.

Upon completion of the puzzle, the player will receive the "Master of Maintenance" [[Advancements|advancement]], and will have effectively completed the achieved the area's goal.

## Original Writing
There are [6 holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Post-75_Areas/Inscription_Complex/) to be found in the Inscription Complex.

One [book](/Lore/Books/), [[Guhnr's Complaint]], can also be found in this building, in a living quarters room.

## Lore
When Avsohm first established a strong presence on [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], they encountered a significant problem: pre-inscribed runic catalysts, the materials that powered the vast majority of their technology, could not be sent through warp towers, as the catalysts were too unstable and would explode upon transportation. Thus, uninscribed runic catalysts had to be sent to the moon, and a facility to inscribe them locally had to be constructed. 

The Inscription Complex was built in a cavern in the domain of [[Loe]], [Aspect](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) of the Cold, because the frigid conditions sustained by her ambient divine magic could replace the machinery's cooling systems as an efficient and costless alternative. However, this area of Lo'Dahr was already populated, as the town of [[Loeturia]] lies just to its north. This was the source of significant tension between the Avsohmic [[Drehmari]] and the local Tehrmari, the latter of whom had lived there for generations, and did not take kindly to Avsohm's attempts to colonize the moon. 

The site appears to have been the home of at least two recurring figures in Avsohmic history: Hirhla and Guhnr.
