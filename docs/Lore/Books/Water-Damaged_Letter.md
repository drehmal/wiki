### Transcription:

> I hope you're doing well. You were right, writing letters really is the best way to stay in touch. There's something so satisfying about ripping open an envelope and unfolding the message inside.

> There has been more activity around here than ever. A constant stream of people entering and leaving the Military Technology Wing has become the new normal. Officers stationed across the realm have been suddenly returning to the Veldt, and fresh-faced recruits are arriving in record numbers.
>
> In my role as delivery person between the Vault and Foundry, I have caught onto some other tidbits. Red Dawn is suddenly requesting several of our more advanced energy relay systems and laser weaponry for a project called the "God Machine". I had always assumed those alchemists were more interested in spirituality and rhythmic chanting and spirituality than technology, but maybe they're turning over a new leaf? Even more strangely, Green Serpent is requesting a very large number of combat vehicles. With the empire safer than ever, why would they suddenly need to start protecting trade convoys again? Nothing is adding up.
