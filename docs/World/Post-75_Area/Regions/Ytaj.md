## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[ytaj.png]]

**Ytaj** (pronounced yih-tie or yee-tie) is the 15th region of [[Lo'Dahr]]. Distinct from the other regions, which are the domains of one of the many [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), Ytaj is a massive palace complex, which is heralded as the sacred meeting place of all the gods of the realm of Drehmal. This area is the most intricate build in the map of Drehmal, containing a vast array of grandiose white buildings, meeting halls, shrines, and living quarters of the gods themselves. It is located in the far north of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, extending out beyond the moon's otherwise roughly square boundaries.

Ytaj borders [[Vayniklah's Domain]] to the west, [[Moen's Domain]] to the south, [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the southeast, and [[Lahrs' Domain]] to the east. It is primarily accessed through a massive bridge that extends due north from Moen's Domain.

## Geography

The city/palace portion of Ytaj, or Ytaj proper, is circular, but the overall region takes on more of an upside-down pear shape, owing to the massive bridge that extends south between Ytaj proper and Moen's Domain. The palace is surrounded by a larger ring of gardens and statues, themselves enclosed by a larger wall. The entire landform is surrounded by a moat, fed from the west by the river in Vayniklah's Domain. 

The primary point of access is a massive white and purple bridge which runs north/south from the palace to Moen's Domain, stretching for over 500 blocks. A lake is found underneath one portion of this bridge, contained entirely within the island.

### Design

Ytaj's aesthetic pulls on heavy use of white, purple, and blue, with all buildings in the area made primarily out of some combination of quartz, calcite, diorite, amethyst, and infused amethyst.

Individual rooms in Ytaj heavily reference color schemes related to specific Aspects or Deities, as most of the rooms in Ytaj are dedicated to one specific god. The colors of the four Elders—yellow for [[Khive]], blue for [[Dahr]], red for [[Taihgel]], and purple for [[Rihelma]]—are very prominently featured, both in the design of banners and symbols around the area and in items tied to Ytaj.

## Gameplay

There are no enemies that naturally spawn in Ytaj.

There are, however, many unique gameplay elements in this area.

### Traders

#### Precocious Kinah

![[kinah.png]]

**Precocious Kinah** is an ascended cat, who serves as a protector of the palace and a merchant to the player. She is located at the very front of Ytaj's main eastern hallway, sitting upon a small pillar. Kinah sells multiple [[Trinkets]], and deals primarily in ![[divine_bauble.png]]{ width="24" } **Divine Baubles**, a kind of custom currency that is found only in Ytaj. Divine Baubles can be found as loot throughout the palace complex, and can also be purchased (for a relatively high price) from Kinah.

#### Benefactor Zabuyah

**Benefactor Zabuyah** is a [[Tehrmari]] trader found in the main eastern hall of Ytaj, in a room just behind Precocious Kinah and to the right. Zabuyah sells books (the merchant directly sells trapped chests, but each chest simply contains a book of the same name), which serve as hints toward the locations of [[Devotion]] shrines on the [[Overworld]]. There are 11 of these books, with alliterative titles that tell the player a hint as to the general area of each shrine. Each book costs 12 Amethyst Shards.

**Coordinates:** (-5, 29, -1562)

#### Runic Blacksmith

A Runic Blacksmith is found in southeastern Ytaj, in a small yard behind Rihelma's room. This Runic Blacksmith sells [[Artisan Items#Ytaj|three artisan items]], all themed after the La'Tehrmari subdivisions—the Talon, Wingmakers, and Scalebound priests.

**Coordinates:** (35, 29, -1535)

### Secondary Devotion Shrines

Each of the 11 Deities and Aspects who have a [[Devotion]] shrine (the three [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/) and eight [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/)) has a secondary shrine somewhere in Ytaj, where they can be given offerings just like their primary shrine on [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. Devotion progress is global, so if you have already maxed out your devotion to a certain Aspect, giving additional offerings at Ytaj will not do anything. Conversely, if you are unable to find a shrine on Drehmal, you can use the Ytaj one instead.

For coordinates of secondary Devotion shrines, see the corresponding Deity or Aspect's "Room" section in the Points of Interest portion of this article.

### Dialogue Interactions

There are two entirely optional, but extensive dialogue interactions to be found in Ytaj, both in one of the tallest towers in the northern side of the palace.

#### Tower of Drehmal

The Tower of Drehmal is the tallest tower in Ytaj, located at the northern end of the region and accessed at the ground level either through one of the side wings or directly from the Prismatic Council Chamber. The Soletta is located in the base of this tower, and behind the Soletta, one will find a small gate which reads "Tower of Drehmal, Begin Ascent^". Beginning the climb up this tower will initiate a dialogue sequence, known officially as "Dreams of the Serpent", or simply the "Dream Dialogue".

![[dream_dia_intro.png]]
> The first two lines of the Dream Dialogue.

The Dream Dialogue is presented differently from the rest of the text in Drehmal, with an alternating combination of text cues in the chat and lines spoken directly by Drehmal at the top of the screen. This sequence lasts for approximately 9-10 minutes, and will pause if the player leaves the bounds of the tower, later resuming if that player returns to the tower. The dream only occurs once per player normally, but it can be viewed again by using the `/function players:misc/dream_dia/reset` command.

??? question "Dream Dialogue Content"
    The Dream Dialogue appears to depict the player actively partaking in [[Drehmal]]'s dream, while being simultaneously addressed by the Realmbinder, who gives a verbose monologue about their ancestry and the fundamental nature of entropy and change. The text cues in chat indicate that the player begins to feel as if they are Drehmal, born of the [[Primal Tree]] and immensely powerful, before snapping back to reality as Drehmal consciously shifts the direction of their dream. They end the sequence by dreaming about their hypothetical awakening, returning to live among the people they created, finding fulfillment in their company once again until the inevitable end.

    A full transcript of this sequence can be found [[Dreams of the Serpent|here]].

![[tower_of_drehmal_interior.png]]

The full dialogue sequence can be seen without fully climbing the tower, but climbing to the top will bring the player to Drehmal's secondary shrine. The ascent requires players to perform some slightly difficult traversal—jumping between platforms, swimming up waterfalls, and climbing some vines. About 2/3 of the way up, players will come to a solid platform, which branches off to the other two tallest towers in Ytaj, southwest and southeast of this tower, respectively. An empty shaft to the north can be dropped down safely, bringing players to a hidden chamber right next to the beginning of the climb, with a block that can be broken to create a shortcut. This shaft serves as an elevator, allowing easy return up to the platform without having to navigate the entirety of the terrain again. Drehmal's shrine at the top is accessed by touching the particles on the area's floating islands, which give the player 4 seconds of Levitation II.

#### Tower of Maelihs

From the elevator platform at the Tower of Drehmal, two carpeted paths lead out to other towers, with a red one leading to the southwest and a blue one to the southeast. Predictably, these two paths lead to towers dedicated to [[Maelihs]] and [[Virtuo]] respectively, the two other Deities. Virtuo's tower to the southeast contains her private chambers in Ytaj, including [[Artifacts#Fortitude|her shield]] and a [[Closed Diary|lore book]] written by the Goddess herself that explains her current whereabouts. Mael's tower, to the southwest, however, contains something even more interesting: the Burnt Lord himself.

In the western tower—Maelihs' tower—Mael himself is found sitting in his throne, idly lounging and occasionally tossing a knife into the air. He speaks to the player through the in-game chat, and has a full dialogue tree, which has a complete transcription [[Mael Dialogue|here]]. Special dialogue lines can be heard if the player first meets Mael with full [[devotion]] to him, or if they approach him at any time while holding [[Malevolentia]].

## History

It is unknown exactly how old Ytaj is, but it does appear to have served as the center for the Aspects' affairs on Lo'Dahr since at least the mid-Second Avihm. Ytaj likely originated no earlier than early Av2, as it prominently features towers specifically dedicated to the Deities, who did not exist in Av1. Ytaj could have plausibly been built as a direct result of the Aspects largely withdrawing from [[Drehmari]] affairs on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], as they seem to have had a minimal presence on the [[disc]] since at least mid-late Av2, and would have needed a new home.

Ytaj was a central location in the events of the [[Divine Schism]], which saw the Aspects split into two warring factions, the Palaesidans and Anti-Palaesidans, named for Palaesida, the Aspect of Storms, whose actions arguably set the entire Schism in motion, and whose death brought about its end. Ytaj saw at least two battles (implied by the fact that two artifacts reference a "First" Battle of Ytaj) during the Divine Schism, and appears to have been under control of both sides at different points in the war.

After the Schism, which resulted in the deaths of [[Noha]], [[Palaesida]], and (indirectly) [[Voynahla]], the Aspects mostly became reclusive, fearing that they too could lose their lives if they dared to show their physical forms. As a result, astral projection to Ytaj became the primary means of communication between the Aspects, and today, as we learn from Mael, only a few Aspects—including [[Dahr]], [[Khive]], [[Nahyn]], and [[Dahroehl]]—still visit physically on a regular basis.

At some point, [[Yriel]], the servant of the Aspects, was sent into Ytaj to murder a large faction of the Talon, effectively the La'Tehrmari police/guard force. The Talon had become a corrupt, incredibly oppressive force on Lo'Dahr, particularly prejudiced against the Ro'Tehrmari, and the Aspects, while unable to interfere directly, decided to act against them. Yriel, using their [[Syzygy|signature weapon]], single-handedly slayed the majority of the Talon in Ytaj, greatly breaking the faction's grasp on the moon.

The Prismatic Council appears to be the official name for a gathering of all the Aspects and Deities, with their meetings taking place in the grandiose Prismatic Council chamber near the center of Ytaj. Several important meetings are known to have occurred here, particularly towards the end of the Third Avihm, when [[Khive]] summoned Mael and Virtuo to Ytaj in order to fully explain their origins, as well as Virtuo's final interaction with the Aspects before departing for [[Eastern Xivrhynt]].

Today, Ytaj appears much less densely inhabited than it was at its peak, with only a handful of Tehrmari servants, Maelihs, and Precocious Kinah currently living in the palace.

## Layout (Points of Interest)

Ytaj is technically a full region, but unlike the other regions, nearly everything in Ytaj could be considered a point of interest. Therefore, this section serves as a more in-depth description of Ytaj's layout, touching on almost everything in the area.

### Entrance

The entrance to Ytaj, just past the bridge, consists of 18 murals, 3 blocks wide and 10 blocks tall (9 along the western and eastern walls, respectively). These murals each represent one of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), with the exception of [[Verrhys]] and the four Elders, who are featured even more prominently throughout the palace. Wool banners at the front of these two walls represent two Elder Aspects each.

![[ytaj_murals_west.png]] 
> The western mural wall.

On the west, a banner of yellow and blue sits at the front, representing [[Khive]] and [[Dahr]], whose rooms are found in western Ytaj. From right to left (north to south), these murals represent the following Aspects:

- [[Vayniklah]], depicting a tree. <br>
- [[Loe]], representing cold. <br>
- [[Dahroehl]], depicting a river. <br>
- [[Noha]], depicting flowers. <br>
- [[Loeleyhn]], depicting snowflakes. <br>
- [[Koh]], depicting different types of stone. <br>
- [[Mari]], possibly depicting paper and pen.[^2] <br>
- [[Muhs]], depicting a wolf-like beast face. <br>
- [[Moen]], showing Moen's signature colors. 

![[ytaj_murals_east.png]]
> The eastern mural wall.

On the east, a banner of purple and orange sits at the front, representing [[Rihelma]] and [[Taihgel]], whose rooms are found in eastern Ytaj. From left to right (north to south), these murals represent the following Aspects:

- [[Voynahla]], depicting a white mask or skull on a field of black. <br>
- [[Lai]], representing heat. <br>
- [[Nahyn]], depicting a snowy mountain. <br>
- [[Rihalae]], representing a wind gust. <br>
- [[Lailoehn]], depicting a flame. <br>
- [[Palaesida]], depicting a lightning strike during a storm. <br>
- [[Lahrs]], depicting a mushroom. <br>
- [[Tethlaen]], depicting two red eyes in a field of black. <br>
- [[Maen]], with an unclear image.

Most Aspects have a flame burning in front of their murals. Three Aspects do not have a flame: Noha, Palaesida, and Muhs—the three Aspects known to be dead. Voynahla's flame is Orderflame (soul flame), unlike the others, referencing the fact that he is not fully alive, but still lives in his own realm of undeath.

### Elder Statues

In the four outer corners of Ytaj's gardens, massive slate statues of the four Elder Aspects can found, showing depictions of their physical forms.

![[ytaj_statue_dahr.png]]{ width="600" }
> Dahr's statue.

[[Dahr|Abyssal Elder Dahr]]'s statue is located in the southwest. Dahr's form resembles a cross between a cobra, sea serpent, and whale, with a blowhole in his diorite crown. He is shown holding a two-pronged trident ("bident"), and has eyes made of glowing sea lanterns. He points to the east, facing the statue of Rihelma.

![[ytaj_statue_khive.png]]{ width="600" }
> Khive's statue.

[[Khive|Mystic Elder Khive]]'s statue is located in the northwest. Khive's form resembles a bearded dragon or other lizard, with black and white flowers protruding from his back and a large stained glass rune hovering over him. He is depicted holding a magical orb of some kind with his left hand, and has flarepod (shroomlight) eyes. He faces south, toward the statue of Dahr.

![[ytaj_statue_taihgel.png]]{ width="600" }
> Taihgel's statue.

[[Taihgel|Land-Fall Drake]]'s statue is located in the northeast. Taihgel's form resembles a colossal tortoise, with volcanic rifts and boulders on their back. Taihgel's eyes are made of glowstone, and the face points to the south, toward Rihelma's statue.

![[ytaj_statue_rihelma.png]]{ width="600" }
> Rihelma's statue.

[[Rihelma|Star-Rise Drake Rihelma]]'s statue is located in the southeast. Rihelma's form resembles a classical wyvern, a massive dragon with two legs and wide, outstretched wings dotted with white spots reminiscent of the night sky. Her eyes are redstone lamps, although they are not lit until a certain end-game milestone has been reached. She faces to the west, toward Dahr's statue.

### Prismatic Council Chamber

![[prismatic_council_chamber.png]]

The Prismatic Council Chamber is a large, domed building located at ground level, just north of the center of Ytaj. This room features over-the-top, vibrant colors, and is contains two rings of thrones, where the Deities and Aspects would sit during full meetings of the Prismatic Council (or rather, where their astral projections would sit). The lower ring contains seats for the 3 Deities and 4 Elder Aspects. The four non-Elder Major Aspects and all of the Minor Aspects (except for Verrhys) have thrones on the upper level. This room also connects to the Soletta, and the base of the Tower of Drehmal, in the north. A massive crystal (stained glass) flower sits on the top of this building.

**Coordinates:** (-69, 29, -1601)

The thrones on the lower level are mostly self-explanatory, heavily utilizing blocks, shapes, and colors associated with their respective owners. Clockwise from the southwest, these thrones belong to Dahr, Khive, Maelihs, Drehmal, Virtuo, Taihgel, and Rihelma, in that order.

The thrones on the upper level, however, all share the same size and solid quartz foundation, with only a few extra colored wool blocks or other blocks on top to signify their owner. The four non-Elder Major Aspects—Lai, Loe, Vayniklah, and Voynahla—are situated on either side of the two entrances to the room, near their respective counterpart. The rest of the Aspects' thrones are not 100% known, but they can be reasonably assigned based on the direction the thrones point (with Aspects' rooms typically being far behind their thrones relative to the center of the room), as well as colors that are associated with those Aspects in banners.

Starting from the green/orange/yellow throne just west of the main southern entrance and working clockwise, the presumed Aspect thrones are as follows: Vayniklah, Muhs, Dahroehl, Maen, Mari, Tethlaen, Moen, Loeleyhn, Loe, Lai, Lailoehn, Nahyn, Koh, Noha, Lahrs, Rihalae, Palaesida, and Voynahla.

The lowest level of the chamber contains an elaborate mural on the floor, and to the south, a small staircase leads down to another room. This room contains six murals on its walls, tied to the [Trials](/World/Post-75_Area/Points_of_Interest/Trials/), as well as one large mural at the end, representing a genealogy tree. This is the family tree of the Aspects and Deities, and it has been the subject of significant speculation.

![[family_tree.png]]

### Tehrmari Quarters

Within the main eastern hall, the living quarters of the palace's [[Tehrmari]] servants are found. This area includes a kitchen for the Tehrmari inhabitants, as well as a large tower with Tehrmari bedchambers. A player head resembling a plush of Maelihs is found at the top of this tower.

### Soletta

![[soletta.png]]

The Soletta is a mythical forge located at the base of the Tower of Drehmal, made up of a giant, closed eye resting beneath two end portal frame blocks. This is a gameplay-pertinent location, whose purpose may not be immediately apparent. The signs around its base provide a hint as to the forge's function.

**Coordinates:** (-69, 31, -1702)

??? question "Soletta Use Hint"
    The signs around the base of the Soletta contain the three Greek letters found on [[Fervor Stones]], surrounded in [square brackets]. These square brackets can be found in the description of another type of items.
    ??? warning "Soletta Use Solution"
        The Soletta is used to upgrade Mythical Weapons, using Fervor Stones. Place a Fervor Stone on the bottom end frame portal block and a Mythical on the upper block, then press the button in front of the chambers. An animation will play, in which the eye beneath opens and the chambers are filled with particles, after which point the Mythical will be upgraded. See [[Fervor Stones#Final Locations and Use|this page]] for details on specific upgrades.

### Aspect/Deity Rooms

In Ytaj, almost every single Aspect and Deity has their own "room"—often a literal room, but sometimes more of a general area. For Major Aspects, these rooms include secondary devotion shrines, and the three Deities each have a full tower dedicated to them.

It is possible that not all Aspects have a room, and some rooms are disputed within the community, but this wiki provides a nearly complete list of Aspect rooms/shrines. Notable exceptions include:

- [[Verrhys]] - Who may have some minor references, but should not be expected to have a room, given that they are not remembered by any of the other Aspects. <br>
- [[Tethlaen]] - Who appears to have one reference, but not a proper room. This may also be due to the fact he disappeared at the very beginning of Av2, and Ytaj was likely built after his disappearance. <br>
- [[Noha]] - Despite being a prominent Aspect, Noha does not appear to have any dedicated room in Ytaj. <br>
- [[Moen]] - Disputed. Moen almost certainly has a dedicated space, the small western garden pictured below, but may or may not have a full room.

![[moen_garden.png]]
> The garden which may or may not be Moen's only true area in Ytaj.

This list is presented in approximate geographic order, starting from Dahr's area in the southwest and circling clockwise back around to Palaesida's Room in the southeast.

#### Dahr's Room

![[room_dahr.png]]

Dahr's area is a large pool in the southwest, containing a floating island with his secondary Devotion shrine at **(-115, 30, -1535)**. Several patches of vibrantly colored coral can be found at the bottom of the pool, as well as an underwater chamber with a throne for Dahr to the north. The pond is fed by waterfalls from the surrounding area, including the glacier atop Loe's room to the west.

#### Dahroehl's Room

Dahroehl's "room" is a tower in the southern portion of Dahr's area, whose exterior is pictured above. The tower itself holds a few cascading fountains to represent the Aspect of Freshwater, which feed into Dahr's larger body of water at the tower's base. A small orb structure at the top of the tower holds a floating block of water.

#### Loe's Room

![[room_loe.png]]

Loe's room is contained within an ice-capped amethyst geode, along the upper western wall of Dahr's area. It is accessible through a staircase that leads up from the far southern end of the western hallway. Loe's secondary devotion shrine is found here, at **(-167, 53, -1528)**. Glacial runoff creates a stream that feeds into Dahr's pond.

#### Loeleyhn's Room

![[room_loeleyhn.png]]

Loeleyhn's room is a tower just to the north of (but not directly connected to) Loe's room. It can be accessed through a doorway in the southwest hallway, or on the upper level from the grassy area outside of Loe's room. The interior of the tower is decorated with murals depicting snowflakes for the Aspect of Snow. A massive icicle hangs from the top of the tower, encasing a column of silent obsidian.

#### Khive's Room

![[room_khive.png]]

Khive's room is a massive tower that makes up a significant portion of the western area of Ytaj, dotted with his signature red sandstone ring structures. Inside the tower, Khive's secondary devotion altar **(-176, 56, -1612)** is found, along with 4 active warp rings, which follow the same mechanic as those throughout the rest of the map. Navigating the warp rings will lead the player upwards to a hidden loot chest, containing a celestial chondrule and Divine Bauble.

??? question "Puzzle Solution"
    To reach the top, you will need to find the correct sequence of linked warp rings. One such sequence is as follows: <br>
    1. Enter the western ring on the bottom level, opposite the shrine. You should find yourself one level higher, at the northern gate in a group of four. <br>
    2. Cross the room to the southern ring on Level 2, and enter it. You should emerge two levels higher, in one of 8 rings. <br>
    3. Go to the connected node, then left to the other connected ring (not the one you came from). Pass through this ring. <br>
    4. You will emerge from what looks like the same place, but you will be across the room. Repeat this process (going through the ring connected to the one you emerged from, to the left) twice. <br>
    5. After three right-to-left portals, you will exit from the left side of the final portal structure. Go from left to right, and enter this final portal (on the south-southeastern wall). This portal will take you to the top.

The outside of Khive's tower is surrounded by warp rings in a stacked, layered pattern at the top, with large infused amethyst columns around its perimeter seemingly feeding some kind of energy (represented by orange stained glass) into the center (or drawing from the center).

Mari's Room takes up the bottom portion of Khive's tower.

#### Mari's Room

![[room_mari.png]]

Mari's room is found underneath Khive's room. It is densely packed with decorations, curiosities, and trinkets from the Laughing Dragon's travels. A skeleton reminiscent of a pterodactyl hangs from the ceiling, possibly belonging to a Kohlohmah, massive vulture-like creatures found in [[Anyr'Nogur]] who are the namesake of the in-game Avsohmic glider, [[Avsohm'Kohl]]. Several items are found behind glass cases on the right (northern) wall, housing such items as the [[Artifacts#Frontier's Edge|Frontier's Edge]] artifact, several custom player heads resembling various technological gadgets, a full set of dyed leather armor, a massive sword, and even a fragment of Otherstone bricks and polished blackstone, highly reminiscent of the known statue of [[Verrhys]]. The [[Simple Haiku]] book, written by Mari to his people in [[Sahd]], is found on a lectern in this room, and a chest high up on the southern wall holds the [[Biography of Dragon Rider Oriann]] book.

#### Maen's Room

![[room_maen.png]]

Maen's room is a chamber just to the north of Mari's room, connected to the same hallway beneath Khive's tower. It is filled with burning flames and various torture implements, reflecting the Aspect of Hate's violent nature.

#### Library Room

![[ytaj_library_room.png]]

The Ytaj library room, connecting to Khive's tower from the east, is somewhat disputed, but is likely Moen's room. This room is filled with dozens of layers of bookshelves, as well as floating white candles in the air. A path to climb up through the room does exist, in addition to a spiral staircase on the side that leads up to a glass bridge through the room, which in turn leads to Khive's tower. 

A book, [[O Tethlaen]], is found on a lectern at the bottom level of this room, expressing a hope that the Ever-Fear will one day return and praising him. This book also refers to Tethlaen as "sibling," which, if taken literally, would imply that the author of this book is one of Tethlaen's direct siblings in the Emotion Trio—either Maen or Moen. A pink, red, and magenta banner is also found hanging in this room, which matches with Moen's general color scheme elsewhere.

A 4x4 map of Ytaj, created with in-game maps, is also found in this room. 

#### Parkour Tower

![[room_teth.png]]

North of the library room, a black and white tower can be found, with an entrance from its northern side. The interior of the tower consists of a parkour course, which loops through the library room and also requires the player to climb around the outside of the tower at one point. A chest at the top contains a Divine Bauble and a Dragon's Breath, likely linking it to Tethlaen, although it appears to be more of a reference to the Aspect than a true room where they would have lived.

#### Vayniklah's Room

![[room_vay.png]]

Vayniklah's "room" is an outdoor area just north of Khive's tower, dominated by a massive flowering tree made of stripped birch wood and yellow terracotta. Vayniklah's secondary devotion altar is located at the base of this tree, at **(-183, 45, -1649)**. 

#### Muhs' Room

![[room_muhs.png]]

Muhs' room is a lush den located beneath the parkour tower, made up primarily of brown terracotta walls and filled with mushrooms, strongly resembling Muhs' home on Drehmal, the Underwood. There are no notable features inside the room besides a chest with a Divine Bauble and some other loot.

#### Maelihs 

Maelihs's tower is located in the far northwest of Ytaj proper, with two discrete levels. 

![[room_mael.png]]

The bottom level is accessible from the other rooms at ground level in Ytaj's western wing, sharing an intersection with Khive and Vayniklah's areas to its south. This level contains Mael's secondary devotion altar in its base, at **(-147, 35, -1688)**. The lower level, encompassing about 100 blocks of vertical space, also includes a large tower over the shrine, plus a spiral staircase along the walls of the tower.

The upper level, accessed from the elevator platform in the Tower of Drehmal, is where Mael himself resides, and contains his personal quarters. This includes a massive deity-sized bed, kitchen, hot tub, and throne, as well as several kegs of mead. A curved staircase leads up to a rooftop garden, full of sweet berries, rose bushes, and poppies, plus a Mael-sized chair overlooking the rest of Ytaj.

#### Drehmal

![[room_drehmal.png]]

The Tower of Drehmal is the tallest building in Ytaj, located at the far north of the palace complex, directly behind the Prismatic Council Chamber. It contains a 130-block climb, themed around nature, during which the Dream Dialogue sequence plays out (if the player has not climbed it before). This climb will bring the player up to a platform where an elevator shortcut can be opened. From the elevator platform, the player can utilize levitation pads to reach the top of the tower, pictured above. This is where Drehmal's secondary devotion altar is found, at **(-54, 219, -1718)**.

To the north, a pond surrounds the tower in an arc, stretching from west to east, with several small islands reminiscent of Drehmal biomes. On the tower itself, eight triangular side rooms, encased in glass and each containing a distinct mini-biome, protrude from the secondary intercardinal directions (NNW, NNE, ENE, etc.). All of these except for one can be accessed without breaking blocks, and 6 can be accessed from somewhere within the tower, during the initial climb.

#### Virtuo

Virtuo's tower is located in the far northeast of Ytaj proper, with two discrete levels.

![[room_virtuo.png]]

The bottom level is accessible directly from Taihgel's room in the eastern wing of Ytaj. This level holds an ornate fountain and pool, similar to the one found at the [[Kiln of Virtuo]], as well as Virtuo's secondary devotion altar at **(9, 64, -1706)**. The pool is filled by a series of fountains originating from a fish tank high up in the ceiling, which forms the barrier between the two levels as well.

The upper level has a very similar layout to the upper level of Mael's tower, including a deity-sized throne, bed, pool, garden, and kitchen. A desk is also found in a room next to the throne, with a lectern holding the [[Closed Diary]], the last known writing by Virtuo before her departure for [[Eastern Xivrhynt]]. The [[Artifacts#Fortitude|Fortitude]] artifact can be found in a chest next to her bed, along with a player head resembling the Goddess.

#### Taihgel's Room

![[room_taihgel.png]]

Taihgel's room is located in northeast Ytaj, just south of Virtuo's tower, directly above Lai's room. Taihgel's room is an expansive quartz room with elaborate stained glass windows, centered around an elliptical map. This is believed to be a map of the ancient world of [[Overworld|Drehmal]] in the First Avihm, before the [[Felling]] and Drehmal's reshaping of the world drastically changed the terrain. The map features three roughly equal-sized continents, with the outer two continents containing a single flower (a chthonic/wither rose in the west and an oxeye daisy in the east) and the central continent of Primzahl containing an azalea, representing the [[Primal Tree]].

Taihgel's secondary devotion shrine is located at the western end of this room, at **(-9, 71, -1655)**. Behind this shrine, the windows are decorated with stained glass murals, depicting a tree in the center and two identical flowers on either side.

#### Lai's Room

![[room_lai.png]]

Lai's room is located in northeast Ytaj, directly beneath Taihgel's room. The room is centered around a massive, multicolored flame (actually a sculpture made of stained glass representing a flame), similar to those found in [[Merijool]]. Lai's secondary shrine is found in the western end of this room, at **(-10, 37, -1655)**. 

#### Lailoehn's Room

![[room_lailoehn.png]]

Lailoehn's room is a direct offshoot of Lai's room, a smaller chamber to its east connected by a small staircase, and with an exit leading out to the north towards the Tower of Drehmal's pond. A small structure along the eastern wall can be interpreted as either a throne for Lailoehn, or a statue of the Aspect himself.

#### Lahrs' Room

![[room_lahrs.png]]

Lahrs' room is a large auditorium, located in the far east of Ytaj proper. The room features four rows of seats arranged in a semicircle around a central stage, which holds a massive drum set, presumably for Lahrs to play on. At the top of the room, a projector/spotlight apparatus angles down towards the stage. The room draws heavily on Lahrs' connection to music, but also plays into his fundamental role as the Aspect of Resonance, mediating the balance between all things. The circular murals on the walls seem to represent some of these delicate balances, with the two on the right representing the struggle between heat/cold and land/sea.

#### Nahyn's Room

![[room_nahyn.png]] 

Nahyn's room is located directly above Lahrs' room in eastern Ytaj, accessible via a small bridge from the intersection outside of Lai and Taihgel's rooms. The room itself contains a replica mini-mountain, complete with saplings, a small stream, and snow on its cap.

#### Koh's Room

![[room_koh.png]]

Koh's room is a direct offshoot of Nahyn's room, to its south. It resembles a cave, filled with magma blocks and lava. Different types of stone are displayed on the walls, with amethyst prominently featured in the ceiling and a sarcophagus-like structure made of obsidian and silent obsidian sitting at the end of the room.

#### Rihelma's Room

![[room_rihelma.png]]

Rihelma's room is among the largest in Ytaj, comprising an entire tower in the southeast. This tower is capped off by a massive dark blue dome, and dotted with sea lanterns resembling stars. This room is located directly above the Tehrmari kitchen, and has special elevator columns in its corners, allowing for travel up to and down from the secondary devotion altar at the top level, at **(17, 82, -1569)**.

#### Rihalae's Room

![[room_rihalae.png]]

Rihalae does not appear to have a full "room," but the small, open-air tower that protrudes from the southeast corner of Rihelma's room is likely the closest thing she has to one. The only thing of note here is a chest containing a Divine Bauble and some other loot.

#### Worn Ironreed Rod Room

A hidden room in southeastern Ytaj, only accessible by swimming through the stream that flows south past Rihelma's room, appears to be the only possible room for Noha. This room consists of two chambers—the upper chamber appears to be the living quarters of a mortal, where the [[Artifacts#Worn Ironreed Rod|Worn Ironreed Rod artifact]] is found, which tells the story of a pair of thieves that grew up in [[Athrah]] and were separated, only being reunited decades later, presumably in Ytaj somehow.

![[room_noha_maybe.png]]

The lower chamber is made up of red, green, yellow, and orange terracotta murals, mostly depicting flowers, with walls also lined in copper. An orange stained glass window looks out towards the Runic Blacksmith, and the stream drains out, creating an exit.

This room could be dedicated to Noha, with the imagery of flowers being connected to her. However, the combination of its relative inaccessibility and proximity to/continuity with Tehrmari living quarters makes this seem unlikely. Furthermore, the region of [[Casai]], where the two people referenced by the artifact were from, has absolutely no known connection to Noha.

#### Voynahla's Room

![[room_voy.png]]

Voynahla's room is located in southeastern Ytaj, just down the stairs to the right of Precocious Kinah in the main eastern hall. This room, like his domain, is dominated by black and red, with occasional white accents, and features a walkway that leads to his secondary devotion altar, at **(1, 21, -1540)**. Behind the altar sits a large black skull, made out of coal blocks, which appears to be the real physical skull of the Aspect of Death, as it was known to have been exhumed using [[Artifacts#Sepelitem|Sepelitem]] after his death.

#### Palaesida's Room

![[room_palaesida.png]]

Palaesida's room is the final Aspect room using this ordering convention, and is located in the southeast of Ytaj, just to the east of the entrance. It is a circular room with a ceiling made out of gray wool and white/yellow stained glass, simulating storm clouds and lightning strikes. In the center of the room, a carpet pattern appears to show the color scheme of Palaesida's face when he was alive.

Palaesida's room is relatively unique, containing a series of stone tablets with signs around the room, which tell the story of the [[Divine Schism]], the conflict that claimed Palaesida's life, likely erected as a memorial to the fallen Aspect after the Schism. These signs are the clearest tie between the Divine Schism and the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]] on Drehmal. The signs read as follows:

??? info "Palaesida Tablets Transcription"
    A meeting of the Prismatic Council commences, <br>
    And Palaesida, our dear hero, is on the agenda. <br>
    In prankish standard, he once again, <br>
    Ruined a plan of the hateful Abominate Maen. <br>
    Loe and Lai discuss, in turn, the Frostfang, <br>
    And Palaesida gets off without a single hitch. <br> <br>
    Our motley crew is made of three, Sky, Wind, & Snow <br>
    All three are young, and quite immature, at that. <br>
    They discuss themselves, their duty, & their life. <br>
    Then Palaesida ruminates on what he heard, <br>
    Ideas of frost, impish desires; what can be done. <br>
    He still chafes against his limits, to push further. <br> <br>
    Wind and Sky, dearest siblings, already agree <br>
    But Loeleyhn has her doubts, and is unsure. <br>
    She goes to Noha for advice, the wise and noble plain. <br>
    Noha considers for some time, but finally decides. <br>
    "Your friends are reckless, indeed they are." <br>
    "But you are all still young. Go out and enjoy that." <br> <br>
    Thus, they all distract their lofty elders, <br>
    Rihalae stirs a gust within a roaring volcano. <br>
    Loeleyhn creates a flurry of snow, to distract Loe. <br>
    Warmth and Cold both preoccupied, Palaesida strikes. <br>
    He steals the Frostfang from its forge. <br>
    And gifts it to Homli Tahsgan, a Northern Lord <br> <br>
    After the Catastrophe you all know: <br>
    Dear Loeleyhn and Palaesida grow closer. <br>
    With such vast swathes of new frozen tundra, <br>
    The Aspect of Snow is euphoric with her domain. <br>
    The Council blames the three young ones. <br>
    But they could all care less. <br> <br>
    In furious rage the Great Sea King Dahr, <br>
    Shows up to punish Sky. But first! <br>
    The Sky confides: "I worry about my friend." <br>
    "She's different now, and while it's fun, I miss what she once was." <br>
    Dahr, surprised, confronts his son, and gives him sage advice. <br>
    "Talk it out, dear boy. Be honest how you feel." <br> <br>
    A shock! Noha is dead. Heartbreak is the culprit. <br>
    Losing the lush steppe of the north was simply too much to bear. <br>
    Loeleyhn is still changed for the worst, but refuses to care. <br>
    Aspect of Death becomes inspired. A grisly ritual is performed. <br>
    The Aspects, shocked, break out in war. <br>
    The first amongst their kind. <br> <br>
    Battle-lines were formed and fought, with kin against kin. <br>
    Lo'Dahr was shattered, its people astir. <br>
    A Divine Schism, to be sure. <br>
    Tehrmari rallied, soldiers unwilling in a terrible war. <br>
    Portals forged, warmongers beyond now brought to front. <br>
    Ytaj under siege, bodies tallied. <br> <br>
    Long and hard fought, the schism draws to a close. <br>
    Dahr calls pause, gathering all in moon-barrens to the North! <br>
    Palaesida goes to speak, steeped in pride. He will not back down. <br>
    When suddenly, attacked by Maen! Still furious, after all this time. <br>
    Hate strikes Sky down, with a frozen bite, and leaves him to die. <br>
    Aspects in shock! Mortality realized, here our schism concludes.

### Trivia

***

In addition to the Maelihs and Virtuo heads, a player head in the likeness of [[Thresa Vera]] can be found sandwiched in a nook between the western wall of Lai's room and the Prismatic Council Chamber, between Nahyn and Koh's thrones.

***

For the most part, Aspects who have a [domain](/World/Post-75_Area/Regions/) on the moon have a room which is on the same side (west-east) of Ytaj as their domain is, relative to Ytaj. The western regions are owned by Khive, Vayniklah, Dahr, Loe, and Maen, all of whom have rooms in the western half of Ytaj. Rihelma, Voynahla, Palaesida, Nahyn, Lai, Lahrs, and Taihgel own regions on the eastern side of the moon, and have rooms in eastern Ytaj. 

There is one exception to this rule, as [[Moen's Domain]] falls just east of the midline, but her room in Ytaj is in the west. This is almost certainly to hold the Emotion Trio's rooms together, near their parent, Khive.

Noha does not appear to have a room, also technically being an exception, although the one spot that might belong to her is in the east of Ytaj.

***

Around the top of Lahrs' room, a musical staff is drawn on the walls, looping around the entire chamber. Musical notes are placed on the staff as decoration, and while these may seem like nonsensical decoration, they actually do serve a hidden purpose: playing these notes in the correct order reveals Lahrs' leitmotif, present in 5 different songs for seemingly unrelated areas.

[^2]: This mural has been disputed between Mari and Maen. It is most likely Mari, based on prototype versions of this build in the Dev Zone and the fact that Maen and Moen are across from one another in this interpretation.
