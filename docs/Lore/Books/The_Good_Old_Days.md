### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in an abandoned Tehrmian village in northeastern [[Purity Peaks]]/southeastern [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. It provides some insight on the history of the Purity Peaks/Tehrmia region, reminiscing over days when the [[Tehrmari]] presence on the continent was much stronger.

### Transcription:
> It's hard not to get a little misty-eyed when you see the state of this place. The roofs are all falling in on themselves, the shrines are dusty and cracking, and there is no sign of laughter here anymore.
>
> The Tehrmari once had a much larger presence here in the region now called “Purity Peaks”. We would descend from the mountain temple when the sky was right, and spend a year among the Drehmari doing the will of the Aspects. Serving Drehmal was a huge part of everyone’s life, and it was a requirement upon Ascension.
>
> Things really were fabulous back then. The Drehmari of the area would come to town to learn, and within them the Wingmakers found excellent candidates for Ascension. I met some of my best friends that way,  laughing over a game of cards in this very house while discussing the Aspects.
>
> Unfortunately, most others didn’t like it here as much as I did. The Scalebound missed their lives as authorities back home, and the Talon had rebellions to manage.   Eventually, Scalespeaker Ornah made the pilgrimage to Drehmal optional, and that was that. Today, it’s pretty much just us Wingmakers on Drehmal, and we need to travel ever further to find new Tehrmari candidates. It hurts my legs to even think about it.
>
> There was a time when Purity Peaks was called Tehrmia because of the number of my people who lived here. Now, it’s shrunk down to only a few scattered hamlets and houses. I miss those old days.
