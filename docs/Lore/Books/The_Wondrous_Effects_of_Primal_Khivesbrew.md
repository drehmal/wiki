### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in [[The Foundry]]. It describes the beneficial effects of Primal Khivesbrew, a potion developed by [[Red Dawn]] that significantly enhances one's speed, strength, and stamina.

### Transcription:
> The Foundry's main use is for the creation of arms and vehicles of war - but what if our soldiers were the arms themselves? That's the question that our cohort of Red Dawn's R&D has decided to ask. Khivesbrew is one of the most common alchemical infusions that can be found across the realm, used to invigorate and increase the arcane stamina of those who cast with their bodies. It builds potentia within them, and is used before their own body's. When Red Dawn decided to combine this potent substance with volatile, liquified, distilled primal energy, the results spoke for themselves. Increased speed, stamina, strength, even jump height were all observed as primary benefits from a primal khivesbrew infusion. And so long as the user doesn't use up that potentia by casting any spells with their bodies, the effects appear to be permanent!
