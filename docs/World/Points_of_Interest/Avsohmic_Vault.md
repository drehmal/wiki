The **Last Avsohmic Vault** is a secret [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] facility located on an island off the western coast of [[Casai]]. It is home to one [legendary weapon](/Items/Legendary_Items/), an artifact, and two lore books.

Arriving at the Avsohmic Vault for the first time grants the "Vault of Knowledge" advancement. Its location is hinted at by two other books in the world: [[The White Vault]] found in [[Athrah]] and [[Journal of Councilman Kihfs'Mihnar]] found in the [[Insohmic Library]].

## Contents

Several beds and blocks of TNT can be found just outside of the vault's quartz door, seemingly from ineffective attempts to re-open it. A sign on the front of the door is deprecated, but appears to have once read "CONDEMNED BY ORDER OF MASTER VAHID OF INSOHM". The door can simply be dug through to reach the inside.

The inside of the vault is relatively small and simple, and contains only one enemy, a Lost Avsohmic Soldier. The interior branches into two separate hallways, north and south, which then converge again in the back room, where the majority of the custom loot in the structure is found.

A chest in the back of this room contains [[Ultva's Bowblade]], a legendary weapon with hybrid ranged and melee capability. Two more chests in this room host unique lore books, with [[Creation of the Vaults]] on the southern wall and [[Dangerous Power]] on the northern wall.

Back in the southern hallway, a small hole can be seen in one of the walls, revealing a hidden room behind the bookshelves. Breaking through the wall reveals a small chamber with a Taihryte/crucible wart floor, reminiscent of the flesh ground in the [[Birthing Grounds]]. The [[Artifacts#Bloodied Nullblade|Bloodied Nullblade]] artifact can be found in this room, resting on the ground.

## Lore

This chamber is one of the Vaults, whose creation was ordered by the Avsohmic Emperor [[Ifeihl]] in Av2 1724 to store pieces of knowledge that were dangerous to the public. In particular, this vault was focused on information surrounding the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]] and [[Primal Energy]]. Its access was exclusive to higher ranking members of the Avsohmic government. 

Following the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's collapse]], the vault presumably stood untouched for centuries before it was rediscovered by the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]]. [[Ultva|Master Ultva]] in particular took an interest in the vault's contents, serving as a treasure trove of advanced Avsohmic secrets which he was desperate to understand. Ultva eventually lost his mind in this vault, possibly having taken his own life with the Bloodied Nullblade found there.

Following the death of Ultva, [[Vahid]] ascended to the title of Master of Insohm, and ordered that the vault be sealed again. It appears that the vault was not touched again between that time and the player's journey well over a century later.

### Trivia

In very early concepts of Drehmal, the Avsohmic Vault was loosely modeled after the vaults from the *Fallout* series.
