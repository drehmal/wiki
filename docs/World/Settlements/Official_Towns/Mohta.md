# Mohta

![[Mohta1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Mohta** is a town in the [[Lorahn'Kahl]] region. The smallest of Drehmal's 14 official towns, Mohta is more akin to a small fishing village than a true town or city. It sits on the southern tip of the peninsula that makes up the eastern half of Lorahn'Kahl, and can be accessed via a path that leads south from [[Palisades Heath]], or the path that travels along the southern coast of Lorahn'Kahl.

	Approximate Coordinates: `-49, 71, 5235`

Mohta is a small, humble beach village, made almost entirely out of small oak/jungle wood huts with dark prismarine/prismarine brick roofs.

Entering Mohta for the first time grants the "Village of Three Moons" advancement.

### Town Square

The town square, containing the village map, is found near the center of Mohta, next to a large pillar. Item frames around this pillar hold some potentially useful items, such as a golden apple, a nautilus shell, and the [[What Lies Beyond The Veil|What Lies Beyond the Veil?]] book.

### Mohta Marketplace

The Mohta marketplace is a single large jungle wood/prismarine structure just north of the town square, home to three permanent specialized merchants.

### Tergei and Son's Smithy

Tergei and Son's Smithy is the site of Mohta's Runic Blacksmith, just to the east of the marketplace. The "[[An Unusual Order]]" book can be found here.

### Crystal Catch

The Crystal Catch is a small establishment just to the west of the town square, where a custom villager sells potions that grant the Dolphin's Grace effect.

### Other

Partially-used farmland does exist near the beaches, which can be harvested or utilized by players. There are also three docks at Mohta, containing some modest loot.

## Lore

Mohta does not seem to have particularly significant lore relevance, as its advancement clarifies that it was founded well after the fall of the [[Tri-Moon Theocracy]], the most pertinent political entity in Lorahn'Kahl's history. However, it was certainly affected indirectly by the Theocracy's actions, having unleashed hordes of undead unto the world, and may have been founded by those who survived the collapse of the Theocracy.

Mohta is also the only surviving Drehmari settlement in Lorahn'Kahl outright, and one book suggests that some people of Eloa may have ended up in either Mohta or [[Tharxax City]].

Mohta does appear to have some trade relations with eastern cities including [[Firteid]], based on the [[An Unusual Order]] book.

## Extras

### Notes

Due to the shape of the terrain outside Mohta, a particularly high number of hostile mobs often spawns directly outside the village walls. For this reason, being around Mohta at night can be dangerous.

### Soundtrack

The theme song of Mohta is "Celestial Pearls", by Drehmal composer Chris Nesja.
