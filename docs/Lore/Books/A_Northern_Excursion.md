### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the Casain Residences of [[Dusps]]. It references the large Avsohmic pipes found in the northern portion of [[Akhlo'Rohma]], and the author resolves to follow them to their origin to the north.

### Transcription:
> I just got back from Marahza, that greenhouse village far to the north of Dusps. It was a lovely time. After visiting with family and sampling some of the many new vintages of Duspian honey-wine (or “mead”, as the locals call it) that they are brewing, we went out on a trip across the wide Resting River. That ended up being the most memorable part of the trip for me!
>
> Out there, several ancient quartz pipes that are thicker than my house soar way over land and water alike before disappearing into the ground. One can only guess what their original function was, but my brother-in-law said that some experts from the Golden Order have identified them as Avsohmic in origin.
>
> On our way out the door, he and I decided that we are gonna follow the pipes to their origin next summer. We’ll also hopefully catch some gulf sturgeon as we go. I haven’t been out on an adventure in the wilderness before, and I cannot wait!
