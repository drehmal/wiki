# Orix Cehein

Chief Observer **Orix Cehein** (pronounced "orr-icks see-hine") was a very high-ranking [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] officer and a powerful [[Arcanism|arcanist]]. Much of the lore surrounding Avsohm's actions at [[Mt. Yavhlix]] revolves around Orix. 

Orix is one of the members of the Stasis Eight, the eight characters that players can spawn as. He was located in Pod 5.

## Description

A character description for Orix from official promotion posts reads as follows:

> Chief Observer Orix Cehein is a lifelong servant of Avsohm and among Anyr’s most trusted aides. Very cautious and driven, he was formerly a powerful arcanist before beginning his current duties. Orix possesses great negotiation skills and has a soft spot for small animals.

Orix is the oldest member of the Stasis Eight. A tall and lean man, standing at 6'2" (~188 cm), Orix has notably extensive runic tattoos, reflecting his past as a talented arcanist. He has relatively light skin and graying hair.

## History

!!! warning "Most of Orix's history is revealed in the late and end-game. This section is written to convey pertinent information without spoiling the discoveries themselves, but it will inevitably spoil some plot points through the [[Resonant Halls]] section."

[[Researcher Cehva's Side Project]] is the most comprehensive source on Orix's early life, establishing that he was once one of the most powerful [[arcanism|arcanists]] in the empire under [[Ifeihl]]'s reign. He was later picked as a close advisor to both Ifeihl and Emperor [[Anyr]], becoming one of the latter's most trusted servants in the empire's later years. 

However, the most significant work that Orix did by far was at the [[Mt. Yavhlix]] facility. Orix first came into the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility|facility]] around the time that Avsohm first ventured into the Spiral Anomaly. He was one of very few to survive the initial events at the mountain that drove most of the on-site staff insane, and is revealed to have communicated extensively with [[Tethlaen]]. There appears to be evidence for at least 27 direct conversations between Orix and the Ever-Fear, and the two genuinely appear to have developed a strong rapport. Other officers write that Orix became extremely obsessed with his work during this time, spending the vast majority of his days studying the tear and querying the Resonant Eye.

At the outset of the [[Fall of Avsohm]], Orix was present at the Primary Energy Collection Facility. Upon first receiving word that something was wrong, Orix ordered that the veilstone seal be put in place over the mountain, and departed for the [[Stasis Facility]].
