### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Last Avsohmic Vault]], on an island off the west coast of [[Casai]]. It details the beginning of these very vaults' construction under Emperor Ifeihl.

### Transcription:
> Emperor Ifeihl, in the wake of the recent censoring of all classified information surrounding the Yavhlix facility, has ordered the construction of vaults that will store said information to keep it exclusive to higher ranking members of the Avsohmic government and certain organizations such as Blue Exodus, Red Dawn, and Green Serpent. These vaults will also store other pieces of knowledge that are dangerous to the public, but the focus will be on the primary energy collection facility beneath Mt. Yavhlix and the applications of Primal Energy.
