# Lo'Dahr

![[zoomed_LD_map.png]]

The divine moon of **Lo'Dahr** is the home of the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/), and the second main dimension available to explore in Drehmal: Apotheosis. The habitable area of the moon encompasses slightly fewer than 3000 by 3000 blocks, making Lo'Dahr significantly smaller than Drehmal. However, the moon adds markedly more extravagant biomes, adds many custom mobs, boasts builds that surpass those found on the main continent, and is even more densely packed with things to do and explore than Drehmal.

The moon is primarily inhabited by [[Tehrmari]] in-game, with Tehrmari settlements (and a few [[Drehmari]] ones) found throughout the habitable area of the moon. Lo'Dahr is home to 14 [Aspect Domains](/World/Late-Game/Regions/), the equivalent of regions, each of which is overseen and owned by one of the Aspects, in addition to the sacred region of [[Ytaj]] in the far north. Outside of these regions is the [[Lunar Wastes]] region, the collective name for the desolate area outside of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, which will quickly kill players who attempt to venture too far into it.

The player reaches Lo'Dahr through completion of the 75% completion event, touching down on a lake in [[Moen's Domain]] after completing the sequence at the [[Aphelion]]. There are [five main story locations](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/Post-75_Locations/) found on the divine moon, leading up to the late game sequence at [[Mt. Yavhlix]]. Lo'Dahr can also be accessed at any point through one of the 6 mysterious portals found on Drehmal, although the knowledge required to use them is mostly confined to the moon. It is also not recommended to do so, as accessing the moon via the intended story sequence makes for a much smoother experience, and the sequence beforehand offers important context on the moon itself.

## Story Progression on Lo'Dahr

At this point in the story (what this wiki refers to as either "Post-75%" or "Late-Game"), the mode of story progression changes. While still not completely linear, the focus does become clearer. There is only one tower on Lo'Dahr—the one dropped by the player from the Aphelion—so story progression is no longer tower-driven. **Once you reach Lo'Dahr, you can complete the story in the intended manner without acquiring any other open-world towers.**

Rather than exploring to find towers and being pointed towards specific locations at completion percentage milestones, Lo'Dahr pushes the player to explore easily accessible story locations, which can be visited in any order. A logical first step is to follow a lodestone compass found on the Aphelion to the [[Core Facility]] in [[Taihgel's Domain]], east of the landing spot. Here, the player will find one holotext that briefly describes the other three accessible story locations, as well as a puzzle that can be solved by applying knowledge learned at those other locations. See the pages for those story locations for further information, including guides on their respective puzzles.

## Exploring Lo'Dahr

Lo'Dahr is very different from the [[Overworld]] in its core gameplay loop, owing to more challenging custom enemies, more precarious terrain, and other quirks.

Being a late-game location, Lo'Dahr is the primary source of celestial debris (ancient debris) in Drehmal, provided that you made it via the Aphelion sequence. In the Aphelion, players must eject a large amount of debris from the ship's reactor in order to progress. When on Lo'Dahr, this space junk that you shot out will occasionally come crashing down to the surface in the form of a (very loud) meteor, landing on the ground and smoking. Touching it will burn the player (as if it is a magma block), but it can be mined. These meteors occur at some scripted locations, such as immediately after warping to the tower for the first time, but can also appear randomly almost anywhere in the dimension. (1)

1. These meteors are one of the primary reasons why render and simulation distance should be the same when playing Drehmal. Meteors appear based on render distance, but can only move when inside a player's simulation distance. Therefore, a higher render distance than sim distance can result in meteors appearing at the edge of a player's view, but becoming stuck, making a very persistent loud noise and only moving if approached.

Lo'Dahr is also home to several custom mobs that can provide valuable resources, including those who would normally be found in the Nether. Hostile mobs on Lo'Dahr do not follow the usual day-night spawning cycle, but rather, spawn at all times. Sleeping is also not possible on Lo'Dahr, as attempting to lay down in a bed while on the moon will simply play the message "Time cannot be passed on the divine moon...".

Many additional points of interest can be found in Lo'Dahr in addition to the main story locations.

### The Trials

The [Trials](/World/Late-Game/Points_of_Interest/Trials/) are a set of six gameplay challenges, set up by various Aspects in their respective domains to test the [[Tehrmari]], seeing who is worthy of ascension to La'Tehrmari status. Players who complete all six trials will be rewarded with a total of two unique Legendary Items, a full set of [[Artifacts|Artifact]] diamond armor, a series of cryptic prophecies from the mind of [[Rihelma|Elder Rihelma]], and a [[Syzygy|Mythical Weapon]].

### Gateways

Six mysterious gate-like structures with infused amethyst floors (typically accompanied by a white quartz gate) can be found on [[Overworld|Drehmal]], and two of these structures can also be found on Lo'Dahr. These are some of the game's most infamous knowledge gates—the solution is not readily apparent, but you technically can crack these at any time. 

??? warning "Gateway Explanation"
    These structures are portals between [[Overworld|Drehmal]] and Lo'Dahr, of which there are six in total. Two can be activated from the Lo'Dahr side—[[Lai's Domain#Gateway Temple|one in Lai's Domain]] and one in [[Loeturia]]—and these two locations are also home to the only explicit hints (found in lore books) as to the activation method for these structures.
    ??? danger "How to Activate Portals"
        Portals can be activated by throwing a single amethyst shard onto the infused amethyst block in their center. This is hinted at by the increased presence of amethyst shards around some overworld portals (such as the Spearhead Forest portal and the Burnt Palace portal), but is not explicitly stated except for in the two books mentioned above.
