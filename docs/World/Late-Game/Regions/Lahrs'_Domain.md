## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[lahrs_domain.png]]

**Lahrs' Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the mysterious Aspect of Resonance, [[Lahrs]]. Covered in fungus and sitting atop a hill that separates it from its neighbors, the region resembles an exaggerated version of Minecraft's Mushroom Island biome. The region is relatively small, and sits in the north-northeastern portion of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, just east of [[Ytaj]]. It borders [[Lai's Domain]] to the east, and [[Taihgel's Domain]] to the south.

## Geography

The majority of Lahrs' Domain is located upon a large plateau, elevating it above Taihgel's Domain to the south and Ytaj to the west, but it is still lower in altitude than most of Lai's Domain, its eastern neighbor. 

Lahrs' Domain is filled with massive mushrooms, commonly associated with Lahrs, and has one major red/white mountain that stands above the rest of the land, next to which [[Lopaja Town]] is found. The ground is primarily made up of mycelium and deepslate, with white accents from calcite and strips of yellow/red concrete tying it together.

There are not truly discernible sub-regions in Lahrs' Domain, with nearly the entire region's terrain being uniformly hilly and with similar levels of vegetation. However, similar to [[Akhlo'Rohma]], the exact appearance of the region's megaflora can act as a way to divide the area into its four corners:

- Northwest: Mushrooms are primarily blue, capped by blue and light blue terracotta. <br>
- Northeast: Mushrooms are primarily purple, capped by magenta terracotta and customized beige mushroom blocks. <br>
- Southeast: Mushrooms are primarily dark brown, capped by black terracotta. <br>
- Southwest: Mushrooms are primarily gray, capped by cyan terracotta and brown mushroom blocks.

The region is mostly square/oval shaped, save for a protrusion to the southeast, which includes a gradual incline from Taihgel's Domain in the south that can serve as a mountain pass, allowing access to the plateau from the south.

## Gameplay

Being a mushroom biome, Lahrs' Domain is the only place on Lo'Dahr where Mooshrooms naturally spawn.

Multiple custom enemies can also be found in Lahrs' Domain, making traversal of the region somewhat challenging.

| **Image**  | ![[cyclofly.png]]{ width="100" }  |
| **Description** | Silverfish with the custom name "Larvolve" may spawn in this biome, and after some amount of time, they will enter a cocoon, turning into a stationary Shulker mob named "Putate". This shulker has thorns, but can be killed, and will release a cloud of poison on death. If this shulker survives for long enough, it will evolve into a "**Cyclofly**", the custom phantom shown above. These phantoms will fly in a small circle just above the ground when idle, and attack the player as usual when approached.  |

## History

Sparingly little is known about the history of Lahrs' Domain, although it is home to a [[Tehrmari]] settlement, [[Lopaja Town]]. This small town/village appears to be thriving.

## Points of Interest

### Lopaja Town

[[Lopaja Town]] is the lone settlement in Lahrs' Domain, located in the northeastern corner of the region. It is home to [[Tehrmari]] villagers, and contains [[Poorly-Written Notes|one book]], which attempts to explain the concept of resonance, the domain of its regional patron.

## Extras

### Trivia

All of Lahrs' domain seems to take some inspiration from the *Pokemon* franchise. The Larvolve, Putate, and Cyclofly mobs follow an evolutionary path similar to those found in Pokemon, and the Larvolve mob is referred to in the datapack as "kakunalarva", referencing the [Kakuna](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Kakuna_(Pok%C3%A9mon)) Pokemon. Furthermore, Lopaja Town follows the naming conventions of Pokemon towns.
