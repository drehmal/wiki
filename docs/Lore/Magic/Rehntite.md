# Rehntite

**Rehntite** is a highly potent mineral in the universe of Drehmal which carries extremely high levels of [[potentia]], or magic ability. The material is also very compatible with runes, which can be used to furthermore enhance its power. 

[[Avsohm]] was able to achieve incredible technological progress (and consequently, great power over the realm) largely due to their discovery and understanding of rehntite.

## Lore

Out of all minerals, rehntite has the single highest inherent potentia, meaning that catalysts made out of rehntite are more efficient and more powerful than those made of any other material. However, it is also very rare. Some regions never discovered any rehntite, and some are extremely rich in it.

The Empire of [[Avsohm]]'s first massive discovery in the reign of [[Drehn]] was the [[Rehntite Cave]] in the northwestern mountains of [[Akhlo'Rohma]]. This cave was home to the single largest source of rehntite ever found in the realm, and Avsohm developed a monopoly on this substance immediately. The Empire also controlled the Islands of [[Island of Dusk|Dusk]] and [[Island of Dawn|Dawn]] in the northwestern seas, home to mendarum crystals, the only substance hard enough to carve rehntite.

The empire would harvest rehntite from this site until its eventual collapse, utilizing the mineral in many various technologies including laser weaponry, experimental armor, and much more.

With the [[Fall of Avsohm|empire's collapse]], all of their secret knowledge about how to use rehntite (and where to find it) was lost. No other societies from the Third Avihm onwards were ever able to harness rehntite's power, even though [[Insohm]] found a deposit underneath the mining town of [[Rhaverik]].

## In-Map

Rehntite is intended to be a part of several devices the player finds and operates in-game, including the elevators found at Avsohmic locations and several weapons. However, the only clear piece of rehntite is the [[Rehntite Plate Mail]], a legendary chestplate found in the fabled Rehntite Cave itself. This chestplate is extremely heavy, making the wearer very slow, but it also gives them an incredible amount of protection. When the wearer is significantly hurt, it sends out a shockwave and slows nearby enemies—this appears to be an effect of the runes carved into it, not an inherent property of rehntite. It glows a light blue, similar to azure (sea) lanterns.
