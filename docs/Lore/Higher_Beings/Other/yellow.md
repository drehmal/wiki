**The Mythoclast**  is the most powerful known being in the universe of Drehmal. Referring to himself as the "titanic power at the center of creation," he is implied to be the ruler and creator of all existence, including innumerable other realms besides Drehmal. He first appears to the player upon completion of the [[Mt. Yavhlix]] dungeon as a disembodied voice, speaking with the name **"???"**. His first words to the player indicate the start of the end-game.

Although his influence is often hidden, The Mythoclast plays a central role in the story of Drehmal, having directly intervened in the realm's history by personally smiting the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]], as well as functioning as the player's guide through the end-game sequence. During these events, he gives several revelations about the history of Avsohm and what ultimately spelled the empire's doom.

## Appearance

The Mythoclast's true material form is not known, as he tells the player it is "difficult to represent," but he presents the player with a mural that purports to capture his approximate image. This mural (pictured below) shows the form of a golden, serpentine dragon. His true name also induces an overwhelming, dizzy sensation upon being heard by mortal ears for the first time.

## Abilities

The Mythoclast possesses an extreme degree of power, with little limit as to what he is able to do. During the story, the Mythoclast demonstrates his ability to effortlessly blast through veilstone, bend runic technology to his will, teleport anyone anywhere, and preserve deceased mortals as puppets, controlling a functionally endless army of higher beings. 

Although not confirmed, it also appears that The Mythoclast might have the ability to cause large structures to disappear (or move elsewhere) entirely, as he is a possible suspect in the disappearance of [[Castle Hovadchear]].

The Mythoclast decides the fate of all souls when they pass through [[Court of Nothing|his Court]] on their way from death to rebirth.

## Personality

The Mythoclast is an authoritative, verbose, and highly self-assured character. He believes himself to be the only being fit to wield ultimate power over the universe due to his own wisdom and experience, and has only been known to directly interfere in mortal history when his crown is meaningfully challenged. While he is unforgiving to those who would attempt to gain such power, Mytho also seems to harbor no particular ill will towards mortals, instead tending to see them as insignificant and uninteresting on a grand cosmic scale.

## In Drehmal's History

When Avsohmic scientists discovered what was believed to be an image of a weapon through the Resonant Eye, they deduced that it must be the creation of an intelligent entity. They named this figure "Him-Beyond", and Emperor Anyr devised a plan to overthrow this being and expand the Empire of Avsohm throughout the universe's many realms. This plot relied on both the forging of the weapon ("[[Mythbreaker]]"), a catalyst of unforeseen power with the ability to breach the Veil, and the creation of the "God Machine" to grant Anyr power akin to that of the Aspects. Mythbreaker was completed in its unpowered form, and the God Machine was activated, reportedly resulting in an initial success. The greatly-angered Mythoclast, to thoroughly eradicate any threat of opposition, struck down Anyr and immediately deployed a legion of beasts including [[Those Beyond]] to destroy Avsohmic buildings, technology, infrastructure, government officials and soldiers with perfectly circular holes, as well as the [[Emissary of the Void]] to kill, dispose of sensitive information and sabotage Avsohm's stasis contingency plan at the [[Stasis Facility]]. This was the [[Fall of Avsohm]], crippling the empire and permanently changing the realm's landscape.

In the Third Avihm, the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] began heavily researching Avsohmic technology with hopes of recreating it and using it to achieve the same dominance over the [[Empire of Maelihs]] that Avsohm had. While there is no clear indication that the Mythoclast struck down Insohm, the fact that its two leaders ended up in his service has led some to suspect that Mytho was behind the disappearance of [[Castle Hovadchear]]. The whereabouts of the castle today, if it still exists anywhere, are unknown. He may have also had a role in the death of [[Ultva|Master Ultva]], possibly due to Ultva's relentless obsession with Avsohmic technology.

## In-Game References

### Non-Story

The Mythoclast's influence can be seen in some places before the end of the game, primarily in the far northern regions. It appears that some Faehrcylian peoples knew of (and possibly even worshipped) the Mythoclast under one of his other names. 

A small structure in southwestern [[Faehrcyle]] holds two items pertaining to Mytho as the "King of Nothing". One of these is a [[Untitled Books#Barhvama Doh|book]] which reads:

> Barhvama Doh, Barhvama Doh
>
> Sinkloh Sahva Sahva Deih Sahva!
>
> Sinkloh Sahva Sahva Deih Sahva!
>
> Amargah Hahgg Grelehma, Broeghethem, Ferh, Dahrbardha!
>
> Myrahlehvamahlokrai!
>
> Praise the Crown!
>
> Praise the Throne!
>
> Praise the Heart!
>
> Praise the Nothing!
>
> Long live the King!

The other is the [[Artifacts#Boots of the Witness|Boots of the Witness artifact]], whose description reads:

> To the King of Nothing, it is all patterns. Only the same people, hopes, triumphs, and mistakes under a new guise, trillions upon trillions of times. But not Drehmal. But not you.

This can be paired with the [[Artifacts#Greaves of the Witness|Greaves of the Witness artifact]], found in northeastern Faehrcyle, whose lore text reads:

> If one were to witness a power so great it tore through gods and empires with ease, what else could one do than revere it?

Together, these items seem to suggest that people in Faehrcyle witnessed the Mythoclast's unstoppable power at some point (likely during the [[Fall of Avsohm]]), and formed a small cult around him. The Boots in particular are the source of a significant mystery in Drehmal's lore: the fundamental question of why Drehmal is so special to the Mythoclast. This may be due to the fact that he had to directly intervene in its affairs, but it is not entirely clear if there is more to this.

Another Mytho-related artifact is found in the far north - the [[Artifacts#Foreigner's Lodestar|Foreigner's Lodestar]] on the [[Frozen Bite]]'s eastern coast. This artifact is not well understood, but reads:

> An old fisherman cast his line into the ocean and almost immediately felt a tug like nothing he had ever felt before. It threatened to pull him off of his feet, but he refused to concede. Unmooring, he allowed the beast to pull his craft westward. He never returned.

The term "Foreigner" is only ever used to refer to this character in one other place: by [[Khive]], in the [[Codex Celestus]].

### End-Game

After defeating [[Tethlaen Boss|Tethlaen]] and returning to Drehmal, a mysterious voice (shown as three yellow question marks, "???") begins to speak to the player in chat. It overrides [[avSYS]]'s compass dispensary to give the player three trinkets in total, which guide the player respectively to [[Azimuth Labs]], then the [[Resonant Halls]], and finally back to the [[Stasis Facility]] (leading to the [[Court of Nothing]]). 

At the first two locations, the player receives details on Anyr's machinations with the Resonant Eye and God Machine from holotexts and additional information provided by the voice. At the Stasis Facility, the unnamed figure reveals his identity as the Mythoclast. He gifts the player a fully-powered version of the [[Mythbreaker]] and teleports them to the Court of Nothing to fight Ultva and Hovadchear, who have been kept alive and under the Mythoclast's control. After the battle, the player is teleported to [[Maddened Path|a location near the Heart of the Void]], the center of the Mythoclast's domain. The end of this area's path sees the player fight The Emissary of the Void, revealed to be [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], founder and first emperor of Avsohm, who is ultimately defeated by the player. The Mythoclast explains that Drehn's soul wished to see the end of his empire, and to grant his wish, Drehn was kept alive by the Mythoclast until now to see the player, the final living remnant of Avsohm. The Mythoclast then takes the player back to Drehmal for the [[True End|very last sequence]] of the game, in which he explains the ultimate fates of the realm's [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/), before offering the player closure.

## Identity

Although there is no implicit reason to assume he has not always been a god, the "true" identity of the Mythoclast has been the source of intense speculation within the Drehmal community. Many have entertained the idea that he may have been born mortal, but managed to ascend to his current level of omnipotence, potentially through completion of the [[Alchemy#Ambition|Ambition]]. It has been theorized that if this is the case, then the Mythoclast may even be a known figure from the realm of Drehmal, potentially explaining why he takes such a strong interest in our realm.

Many characters have been proposed as potential candidates for the original identity of the Mythoclast, although none of these theories have been confirmed by developers or reached any sort of consensus among the community. Such characters include [[Verrhys]], [[Akim]], and [[Aok]], to name a few.

### Trivia

Mytho has an [official Twitter account](https://x.com/mr_o_clast) followed by the Drehmal account, although he has not posted in a long time.

***

Mytho's nickname "yellow" comes from the fact that in early versions of [[Drehmal v2]], he was not given a name or significant lore explanations, and was only known by the yellow question marks that appear when he speaks.
