# Drahbes

**Drahbes** was an ancient city-state in the northeastern [[Gulf of Drehmal]] which rose above its competitors in early Av2, becoming the dominant political power in the key region of Dreh'Noha. Its ruins, built overwhelmingly of granite, are home to the [[Artifacts#Ancient Crown|Ancient Crown]] artifact.

Drahbes may have been the precursor to Old Drabyel and/or the [[Chosen Kingdom]], which would eventually evolve into the realm-spanning [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]].

Drahbes is located around the border of Dreh'Noha, [[Purity Peaks]], and [[Akhlo'Rohma]].

## Layout/Points of Interest

Most of Drahbes is surrounded by a granite and brick wall. Small buildings hold decent assorted loot.

A statue of [[Drehmal]] built out of granite, one of many throughout the [Central Regions](/World/Regions/Central_Regions/) which holds hints for their [[devotion]] offerings, is found along the shoreline.

The main feature of the ruins is a large ziggurat-like structure in the west. Climbing to its top and digging through the one copper block leads down to a chamber with the [[Artifacts#Ancient Crown|Ancient Crown]] artifact.

To the west, outside the old city's walls, a few small huts can be found with living [[Drehmari]] villagers. 

## Lore

Drahbes was the most powerful political force in Central Drehmal during the early Second Avihm. Their exact history is not at all well known, but it is believed that they were a progenitor to the [[Chosen Kingdom]], from which [[Avsohm]] would eventually arise.

Today, a small group of Drehmari live in a settlement next to the ruins, possibly studying it in an archeological capacity.
