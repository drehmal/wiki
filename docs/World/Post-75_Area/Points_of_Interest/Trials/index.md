The **Six Trials** are gameplay challenges and puzzles found at major points of interest throughout the moon of [[Lo'Dahr]]. Each of these trials is found in a different [Aspect Domain](/World/Post-75_Area/Regions/), spread out across the moon's area.

When a trial location is approached for the first time, the following message will play in chat:

## Location Hints
Hints towards the location of the 6 Trials can be found in the Prismatic Council chamber of [[Ytaj]], in the large domed building filled with thrones. On the walls around this room, there are six distinct murals, which depict the terrain around where one of the trials is found. Similar murals are found in the room containing a family tree of the Deities and Aspects beneath the Prismatic Council room, which will have the blocks in front of them lit on fire when completed.

The 6 Trials are spread somewhat evenly across the moon's area, with three in the west and three in the east. Trials can be found in the following regions: <br>
- [[Khive's Domain]] <br>
- [[Rihelma's Domain]] <br>
- [[Nahyn's Domain]] <br>
- [[Dahr's Domain]] <br>
- [[Lai's Domain]] <br>
- [[Vayniklah's Domain]]
