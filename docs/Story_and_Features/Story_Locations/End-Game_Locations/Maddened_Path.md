The **Maddened Path**, located at the **Heart of the Void**, is the penultimate story location in Drehmal: Apotheosis. Located even deeper within the Nothing, at the true center of all creation, it teaches the player some of the deepest secrets concerning the true nature of the universe (multiverse) of Drehmal.

This location is accessed immediately following the [[Court of Nothing]] in the end-game.

    In the True End dimension, these coordinates will take the player to the very first room of the Maddened Path, which is normally accessible ONLY THROUGH THE PROPER STORY SEQUENCE. Do NOT attempt to teleport to these coordinates before reaching them naturally, or you will risk sequence-breaking the map.

## Story
After defeating Ultva & Hovadchear at the Court, the player is given another portal by the Mythoclast leading to the Maddened Path.

> The Maddened Path.

The Maddened Path is a winding path of debris, gradually leading to a large structure at its center. Some of this debris appears to be from Drehmal, including megaflora reminiscent of those from [[Akhlo'Rohma]] and warp rings from [[Khive's Domain]]. The player must navigate through this path as the Mythoclast speaks to them, unveiling many of the final pieces of the story.

The Mythoclast fully admits to the destruction of Avsohm, stating that the empire was meddling with forces it could not possibly hope to comprehend, and that nobody could ever be allowed to take his proverbial 'crown.' He states that the empire could not be allowed to attain the kind of power it wished for, and that although he does not often intervene in mortal affairs, it was made necessary by Avsohm's ambition.

He then pivots to telling the player about another special guest, who has specifically requested to see you, the final remnant of Avsohm, stating that his guest has waited an extremely long time for this. The player reaches the structure at the center, stepping forward to the final boss battle of Drehmal: Apotheosis.

In the arena at the center of the Path, the final boss manifests together: the [[Emissary of the Void]]. The Emissary is a humanoid figure clad in a purple hood, wielding a version of the [[Oblivion]] scythe. 

When the player depletes the Emissary's health bar, he pulls back his hood to reveal his true face, and the name at the top of the screen changes to "Drehn Mal'Sohm, the First Emperor," revealing the true identity of the Emissary.

When the player defeats Drehn, the Mythoclast offers additional insight into what just occurred. Late in his life, Drehn had realized that his empire would grow to unsustainable lengths, and was likely to discover something they should not based on their findings at Mt. Yavhlix. When he arrived at the [[Court of Nothing]] after his death, he pleaded with the Mythoclast to destroy the empire, or to at least allow him to see the end. The Mythoclast obliged, allowing Drehn to remain alive as his servant. Eventually, when the time came, the Emissary was sent to sabotage Avsohm on the ground level, with multiple accounts of him being sighted towards the end of the empire, most notably at the Stasis Facility. His death marks the end of his subjugation under the Mythoclast, and his soul returns to its origin.

The Mythoclast informs the player that "nothing remains," and opens one final portal at the center of the arena, leading to [[True End|one final area]].

## Gameplay
In the Maddened Path, the player remains in Adventure Mode. 

The majority of the area must be traversed by jumping between floating platforms. Typically, if not clear, the path forward is denoted by carpets placed on these platforms. The player is not punished for falling into the void by death like they are at [[The Nothing]], but rather, are teleported back to a prior checkpoint.

There are custom enemies found along the path, but they do not all exhibit hostility toward the player. They each have custom models, and if hovered over, their names appear as garbled text. These include versions of humanoid enemies (skeletons and zombies) as well as guardians.

At the center building, just before the Emissary fight, there is another portal. This portal will return the player to the Stasis Facility to further gear up or take care of other tasks before the final fight, without loss of progress. 

The Emissary fight itself is far and away the most complex in Drehmal, with several different custom animations and attacks. The Emissary can be damaged just like any other entity, and deals a significant amount of damage. For a more thorough description of his attacks and this fight in general, see [[Emissary of the Void]].

After the Emissary fight has concluded, the player can step into the final portal at the center of the arena to be teleported to the final sequence of the story.

## Lore
The Heart of the Void appears to be the core of the Nothing, where the Mythoclast creates realms, and where they are ultimately pulled back at the end of their lifespans. The skybox in this area shows numerous bright spots resembling stars in all directions, although the knowledge unveiled in Avsohm's third dive would suggest that these are all other realms, effectively contained universes. To the south, the player can see a disc resembling Drehmal, which appears barren and covered in sand. To the north, a massive swirling cluster of purple and orange, somewhat reminiscent of an eye, looms over the backdrop of the Path.

This location is referenced elsewhere in the map, but primarily as a mythical or figurative place. In the [[Dusty Tome]], it is written about by [[Akim]], an alchemist who claims to have completed the [[Great Work]] but believes there is still one more Sphere to ascend to, describing visions of the Heart of the Void and whispers pushing him there, presumably from [[Aok]].

## Extras
The enemies along the path whose names cannot be read normally do have names, although they initially appear to be gibberish. The skeletons found throughout the area have the name "Baernd," the zombies are named "Ealdhlaford," and the guardians have the name "Sceotend."

A full transcript of the dialogue at this area can be found [[End-Game_Dialogue.md|here]]. This article contains only the 9th section on that page, the **Maddened Path**.
