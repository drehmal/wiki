This book can be found in an item frame atop a firewatch tower in [[Nahyn's Domain]]. It provides insight as to the origins of the [[Rohei|Roheian Empire]], asserting that Rohei was initially a fusion of two clans that were exiled from [[Naharja]] for engaging in bloody skirmishes with one another in the streets.

## Transcription
> Although all now know of the fall of the Roheian Empire, few are aware that the ambitious nation was nearly smothered in the crib. Indeed, the polity faced its first challenge before the Free Lands of Rohei were even granted. Unsurprisingly, the precursor clans of the Roheian Empire were present during the outbreak of violence that led to their exile, but few know that said violence was not actually against the Naharjan government. Instead, two rival clans, both claiming to represent the true soul of rebellion, were in conflict with each other. One was led by Asa Clasahle while the second was led by Meri Nelahvan. All accounts show that Clasahle and Nelahvan started as steadfast friends as children, but grew apart as they aged. While some might imagine this split to have occurred due to difference in ideology, the truth is surprisingly banal: they had different taste in music. While bitter disagreements of the arts are common, few have matched the intensity of these two rebels. It did not help matters that both friends had steadfast followers, willing to fight and bleed for their taste. The end result was a bloody conflict in the streets of Naharja, akin to the Sculptor Wars in miniature. While much of this violence occurred in the lower districts, it was not entirely contained there. After a particularly publicized attack, in which the Nelahvans defaced the statues of Moen with Clasahlian tags in order to frame them, the clergy of Naharja decided to put a stop to the madness. Both clans were exiled from the city, and granted a small parcel of land as recompense. Forced to live together and faced with living in the wilds, the two friends finally reconciled, and established the Free Lands of Rohei.
