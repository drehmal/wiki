 
# Convictions of Tech-Priest Lakeivaa

--8<-- "minor_spoiler.md"

This book can be found in a chest at the [[Altar of Insight]]. Written by a parent of [[Gohri Zed]], the book explains that the people of [[Veruhkt Plateau]] worshipped and sought ascension to the moon of [[Lo'Veruhkt]], which sits beneath the planet and is therefore seldom seen. It also reveals that Gohri's birth name is Gorui, and that she was sent by her people to study runic magic in [[Av'Sal]] to help them escape to the moon, but stopped communicating with her family after falling in love with [[Thresa Vera]].

## Transcription
> Lo'Veruhkt. The namesake of our people turns far below, as the other heavenly bodies spin above. A brilliant purple hue, so unlike any other thing in nature. On occasion I can catch glimpses of a blinding golden light. Hundreds of millions of souls, the majority of our people. One day, we shall arrive, and unite that-which-is and that-which-is-yet-to-be. So long as one of us survives, Poa's dream won't die.
>
> Though their leader was cruel and their armies were strong, not all was lost on the day of the Desecration. Three of the tech-priests lived, including myself, and the Lens was safe. Though we had lost our prototypes, our plans remained intact.
>
> For nearly two long years, we and our families were trapped beneath the ruined Altar of Insight. It was no longer safe to visit the capital Veruhkaan, (now Sal’Veruhkt), due to the enemy presence there. There were no resources to make a vehicle to take us around the plane to Lo’Veruhkt, nor through it. The only hope left was to use Avsohm’s great power to our advantage.
>
> And so my daughter Gorui and Parei's two sons Davaa and Ran were trained to become our greatest hope. Raised by the light of the forge, Gorui is small but strong, with a smile that lights up the hearts of everyone in the room. She ardently believed in our cause, always wanting to meet our heroes from that-which-is-yet-to-come. By utilizing our contacts in Sal’Veruhkt, she learned as much as she could about the runic catalysts and that wondrous art known as “programming”.
>
> And then, finally, the opportunity we were looking for. It was a young man, sent to Sal’Veruhkt to study the technology they stole from us. A genius, to be sure, but even more idiotic than most young men. We were sure he would fall for my daughter.
>
> Things moved quickly after that for a couple of weeks. “Gohri” showed her worth to the scientists and was gone before the month had ended, bound for Av’Sal. Those of us back at the hidden room by the Lens finished our work transcribing what we could remember of the technology that was lost, and we returned to Sal'Veruhkt as farmers, continuing to train the boys in secret while waiting with great hope for news from afar.
>
> Then there was a lull as we worked the fields and dreamed. My partner Sakoa and I continued to receive letters every month or two from Gorui. We learned all about her friends and studies.
Gradually, she worked her way further into the confidence of our overlords.
>
> But then, one horrible month, the letters suddenly stopped. We sent Ran and Davaa to Av’Sal to check on Gorui after a while, and to our surprise, we learned that she was now romantically involved with the new Chief Science Officer of the Avsohmic Department of Science.
>
> I was doubtful at first when Gorui first stopped sending letters, but now my fears are assuaged. I know that her destiny is to bring us through the great orb we now reside on to Lo'Veruhkt once and for all. That-which-is shall become that-which-is-yet-to-be. My daughter will save all the souls of our people and allow us to live in eternal bliss. Praise to Poa and the Endless Cycle. The moon and the ground shall become one.
