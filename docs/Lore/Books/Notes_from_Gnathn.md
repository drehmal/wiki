> The captain... he's gone.

> Nobody can tell where he went. Last night, he retired to his cabin early after hearing something over the AvWave. He looked pretty scared, but refused to talk about what he heard with any of the crew. We tried the AvWave as well but we just got static from every channel. He's the only one who knows how to pilot this boat. Dahmar already took the reserve escape raft last night without letting us know, he's probably already reached shore by now. The rest of us are probably trapped here for good. Squilhem thinks there might be something in that Red Dawn shipment that might be able to help, but I'm doubtful. We were told to not open it under any circumstances, and we might have enough food to last us until Avsohm sends a rescue team out.
