# Dusps

![[dusps_out.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Dusps**, also known as the **Painted City** or the **Painted City of Dusps**, is an official town found in the [[Akhlo'Rohma]] region. A road that crosses from the Central Regions into [[Purity Peaks]] and past the ruins of Drahbes eventually leads to Dusps, and continues north into deep Akhlo'Rohma, including [[Ancehl Castle]], [[Marahza]], and eventually the [[Veruhkt Plateau]].

	Approximate Coordinates: `2074, 110, -848` 

Dusps is one of the larger and more populated towns in Drehmal, and contains several notable points of interest. The city has an extremely distinct architectural style, with buildings made predominantly out of diorite, a single vibrant color of concrete and concrete powder, and brick or copper roofing.

The town is populated by approximately 95 [[Drehmari]].

Entering Dusps for the first time grants the "The Painted City" advancement.

## Layout/Points of Interest

![[dusps_map.png]]{ width="400" }
> The in-game map of Dusps, immediately inside the city's front gate.

Buildings in Dusps can be easily identified by the primary color of their concrete walls. In all cases except one, the same color will not be used for separate (non-connected) buildings.

### Pink Buildings

The pink buildings include the gatehouse at the front of Dusps, as well as a couple villagers' homes. Some of the unique merchants in the town are found outside these buildings.

### Blue Building

The dark blue building is home to two notable locations: the town's inn and a dye shop.

**The Color Pot Dye Shop** is located in the northeastern section of the building, at **(2059, 111, -815)**. Here, a custom trader sells all colors of dye, exchanging 16 of any color for a single scale.

**The Blossom Bed and Breakfast** is the town's inn, with three different rooms and a merchant who sells food (and then some!). Room C on the upper floor contains the inn's Primal Cache[^1]. On the ground floor, the custom "Potato Connoisseur" trader buys and sells potatoes, as well as a special custom item.

### Dusps Parliament (Yellow)

The Dusps Parliament is located in the far southwest of the town. Initially closed off, the area can be accessed by simply breaking down the wooden door, towering/climbing over, or crawling through an opening into the Servants' Quarters from the nearby lilac garden. This area is full of Nitwit villagers and a single "Visiting Noble", with some modest treasure to be found. A cat named "Judge Eleftheria the XIV" is also found here. The [[MP's Notes]] book in this complex provides an insight into the relationship between Dusps and [[Ancehl Castle|Ancehl]], following the death of the Duke of Ancehl.

### Dusps Library (Lime)

The Dusps Library is the majority of the lime building, with two custom traders positioned outside its front door. Four lore books are found here:

- [[Untitled Books#gaming|gaming]], on a lectern immediately to the right upon entering the building. <br>
- [[The Casain Migration and Its Impact]] on the ground floor, in the bookshelves. <br>
- [[The Crypts of Akhlo'Rohma]] on the second floor, in a chest in the corner. <br>
- [[Journey to the Star-Rise]] in a second room behind the counter to the left of the entrance.

### Light Blue Buildings

The light blue buildings are home to multiple different homes, as well as the living quarters of the town's Runic Blacksmith and a custom barber shop.

### Red Buildings

The red buildings appear to be entirely residential.

### Casain Quarter (Orange)

The orange buildings in east-central Dusps make up the Casain Quarter, the neighborhood where [[Casai|Casain]] immigrants settled and were pushed to in Dusps. Several different establishments are found here, including the Northern Kitchen, a restaurant serving fine Casain cuisine, a chapel dedicated to [[Voynahla]], living quarters containing the [[A Northern Excursion]] book, and more.

### Ehrmion's Home (Green)

The green building in southern Dusps is labeled as the home of "Ehrmion," and contains the [[Previous Cultivator's Findings]] book. It is overgrown, and contains several flowers in its grassy interior, as well as a rabbit named "Pheb".

### Golden Order Star Center

The Golden Order Star Center is a yellow building on the northern edge of Dusps, centered around a small observatory. The [[Prefect's Grumblings]] book can be found here, showing that the site was used to observe the moons of Drehmal.

### Temple of the Virtuous Trinity (Cyan)

In the eastern portion of the city, an open-roofed cyan building is marked as the "Temple of the Virtuous Trinity", dedicated to the goddess [[Virtuo]] and her "Trinity" of Peace, Perfection, and Purity.

### Temple Cemetery

The town's cemetery is located directly behind the Temple of the Virtuous Trinity, and contains several graves that can be exhumed for joke items. Some notable ones include:

|      **Grave Sign**     | **Contents**               |  **Explanation** |
|:-----------------------:|:--------------------------:|:----------------:|
| R.I.P. <br> Keehko <br> "I wish I were me." | Chest with Cat Toy (Unbreaking X Fishing Rod) | A reference to lead developer and Drehmal co-creator Keeko100, and his cat, Priscilla, who is found throughout the map in the form of [[Cat Maps]]. |
| R.I.P. <br> Benahdryl <br> Couldn't wake up | Light Gray Bed | A reference to Benadryl, an allergy drug known to make people very drowsy. |
| fobk (Diorite grave) | Double chest with stained glass panes spelling out "fobk". | A reference to a long-running inside joke in the Drehmal dev team. |
| R.I.P. <br> Malthazar <br> "My friends, Momeo and Muliet." | *Bercutio*, an iron sword with 11.5 attack damage from its Sharpness X enchantment but -749 durability. It is hard-coded to be too expensive to repair or further enchant, and can therefore only be used for one hit before instantly breaking. | Seemingly a reference to Romeo and Juliet. |
| R.I.P. <br> Drehn Mal'Bohm <br> "I'm da bohm." <br> - Prior to death | Bohmplate, a chainmail chestplate with Blast Protection IV and Unbreaking III. | A pun based on [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], the first emperor of [[Avsohm]]. |
| (On back of grave): R.I.P. $wagmohney <br> {BOTTOM TEXT{ | Counterfeit (Custom named green dye, enchanted with Looting III) <br> $wag Pants (Leather Leggings enchanted with Impaling V, Loyalty III, Lure III, Piercing IV, and Power V) | Joke items. |

### The Lord's Garden

The majority of eastern Dusps is taken up by a large garden, consisting of several small flower patches separated by hedges. Several bee nests are found in this area, as well as a magenta concrete tower at the southeastern edge of the city, overlooking the land below.

A statue of [[Virtuo]] is found in the hedges behind the temple,with a glistering melon slice and an orderflame lantern at its base.

Through a small hedge maze at the gardens' entrance next to the cemetery, an additional grave can be found. This grave reads: <br>
> Rest in Peace <br>
> Nihri Voh <br>
> Death by Nothing

The grave contains a single chest with the "Resonant Compass", a compass with a custom model and lore text that reads "It gently vibrates in your hand..."

This compass points toward [[Mt. Yavhlix]].

## Lore

Dusps appears to have been a population center in Akhlo'Rohma since the mid-Second Avihm, with its advancement description stating that the peoples of the region consider it to be the "center of all creation". While this is not literally true, it likely points to Dusps having been a very early settlement in the region, although Ancehl was historically the regional seat of power. 

The city has had varying levels of autonomy during its existence, dating back to its time as a member of the [[Avsohm|Empire of Avsohm]]. During this period, it appears that Dusps was a prominent cultural center, as it has continued to be to the modern day. After the [[Fall of Avsohm]], Dusps remained under the rule of Ancehl, and its demographics underwent a significant shift due to the Casain Diaspora. Fleeing [[Maelihs]], many Casains ended up in Akhlo'Rohma, and many in particular found themselves in Dusps, leading to the formation of the Casain Quarter in early Av3. Casains were heavily discriminated against due to the plight of their land and their [[Voynahla]] worship, perceived to be in opposition to the [[Virtuo]] worship dominant in the east. Tensions steadily rose, with [[Growing Fear|one account recollecting the lynching of a Casain in Dusps]], up until the Dohval Civil War, which ended in the burning of the city of Ancehl and Dusps forming their own political entity, the Kingdom of Dusps. 

Dusps was a constituent member of the [[Insohm|Order of Insohm]] in the third Avihm, but was among the parties who attempted to secede from the Order in Av3 600, beginning the [[Insohmic Civil War]]. Their surrender in Av3 611, upon the capture of one of their cities, marked the end of this war. Upon the dissolution of Insohm, the Kingdom regained near-total independence, despite some influence from the remnants of Ancehl.

[[The Casain Migration and Its Impact|One source]] suggests that Casains have become more accepted in the city in recent years.
