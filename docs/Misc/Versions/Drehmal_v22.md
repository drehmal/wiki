# v2.2: APOTHEΩSIS

**Drehmal v2.2: APOTHEΩSIS** is the most recent major content update to Drehmal v2. Made over the course of more than three years by a greatly expanded team of over 15 developers, 2.2 is by far the largest content update for Drehmal.

2.2 was released in beta form on August 19, 2023, and was fully released on April 5, 2024. It has since received two major updates.

Version 2.2.1, released on July 16, 2024, was the initial port of the map to Minecraft 1.20.1.

A second update, 2.2.2, was officially released on April 15, 2025, acting as a more finalized and polished version of the 1.20.1 port, with some very small content additions.

## Development and Release Buildup

2.2's development began as early as the months leading up to the release of [[Drehmal v21|v2.1]] in mid-late 2020, with the recruitment of additional developers from the community. DomeMaster and Yllusive, the creators of the [[Emperor's Estate]] build, were brought onto the team first, with the size of the dev team slowly growing to over 20 people, encompassing builders, coders, writers, artists, and more.

2.2 was originally planned for release in late 2021, but was delayed several times due to a combination of developer time conflicts, scope creep, and persistent bugs. 

In the months (and years) leading up to the release of the 2.2 beta, the update was teased in several ways. 

The revamped [[Burnt Palace]] was released as a Patreon-exclusive early access level in August 2021, and a demo version of 2.2 (containing only the Central Regions) was released in June 2022.

Spoiler/Teaser images—images of new content in 2.2—were published by developers, accompanied by lore-relevant captions. These images and captions can be found in the #announcements channel of the Discord. In the final days leading up to the official release of the 2.2 beta, a series of [[Unknown Librarian Teaser|teaser dialogue lines]] were given by a mysterious figure in the Discord server as well.

## Changes

2.2 brought sweeping changes to the gameplay systems, story, world, and lore of Drehmal, almost entirely present from the very first beta. Small tweaks and additions have been made in subsequent updates, but the main changes are all listed below under the beta/full release notes.

**MAJOR CHANGES (Mild Spoilers):**

- The main story was reworked from the ground up, with changes made to every single existing [story location](/Story_and_Features/Story_Locations/), including the addition of larger puzzles and changing the rewards for completing these areas. Entirely new story areas were also added, especially in the late game (75% and onwards) and end-game (after Mt. Yavhlix). <br>
- [Holotexts](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/) were created and added to story locations, as a more direct form of providing hints and key lore. <br>
- 15 new pieces of [Legendary Gear](/Items/Legendary_Items/) and 2 new [Mythical Weapons](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/) were added, with several others receiving updates to their textures, abilities, stats, or some combination thereof. <br>
- All legendaries were given their currently existing passive abilities, rather than simply having strong enchantments and custom textures. <br>
- [[Artifacts]] and [[Artisan Items]] were established as item classes, adding over 160 unique pieces of gear to the world with the former and 140 purchaseable pieces of gear with the latter. Some of these items formally replaced previously existing custom items which were named but had minimal lore implications, but the majority of these items are new in 2.2. <br>
- Added the [[Devotion]] mechanic and devotion sites for players to give offerings to the [Deities](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Deities/) and [Major Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/Major_Aspects/), and by extension, [[Relics]]. <br>
- Added custom [[Adventuring Merchant]] and [[Runic Blacksmith]] merchants, which offer specialized trades for adventuring/exploring materials and unique Artisan gear, respectively. <br>
- Added [[Runic Catalyst|Runic Catalysts]], an uncommon type of loot found throughout the world used as currency with the aforementioned new merchant types. <br>
- Added the city of [[Rhaveloth]]. <br>
- Added eleven new [small settlements](/World/Settlements/Other_Settlements/) to the world. <br>
- Fully rebuilt all 39 ruins across Drehmal to be visually distinct from one another, and to have clear lore that sets them apart. Previously, all ruined towns were, for the most part, generic stone brick ruins. <br>
- The terrain of the [[Frozen Bite]] and [[Highfall Tundra]] regions in the northeast were fully rebuilt to stand out more from neighboring [[Faehrcyle]] and add variety. <br>
- A complete custom [[soundtrack]] was added to the game, replacing the previous soundtrack which was made up of tracks from popular video games such as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Hollow Knight, and Bloodborne. <br>
- Massively expanded several ruins and inhabited towns. Most notably, these include [[Firteid]], [[Highfall]], the [[Kiln of Virtuo]], the [[Burnt Palace]], and [[Sal'Anyr]].
- Added various new non-settlement [points of interest](/World/Points_of_Interest/) throughout the world, ranging from small loot structures to massive dungeons and complex structures. These include [[Teiruun Monastery]], [[Ancehl Castle]], and [[Drehua Temple]], to name a few.
- Added well over 100 new lore books. <br>
- Removed access to the Nether. Nether portals now self-destruct almost immediately after being lit. <br>
- Re-textured default villagers to be [[Drehmari]] consistent with Drehmal's lore, making them look like regular humans with antlers. Other races were also given custom textures, including the [[Maelmari]] and [[Tehrmari]], found throughout the world.

**MINOR CHANGES (Mild Spoilers):**

- Abolished class by removing the class boots, replacing them with the much more diverse system of artifacts, artisan items, and relics. <br>
- Added the `/trigger Settings` menu. <br>
- Restructured the [[advancements]] tabs. <br>
- Approximately doubled the number of [[Cat Maps]] found in the map. <br>
- Re-textured and re-named some vanilla items, including the rebranding of emeralds to "scales".

#### Full Spoiler Changelog { data-search-exclude }

!!! danger "WARNING!!! The summary of changes below contains EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT spoilers for the ENTIRE map."

??? warning "2.2 Changes: Full Spoilers"
    ??? danger "Story Changes"
        In general, the story of 2.2 is greatly more ambitious and intricate than that of any previous version. It shifted to focus more on the specific reasons for the [[Fall of Avsohm]], including much more attention on the actions of [[Anyr|Emperor Anyr]] in the final years of the empire's reign. It also gives Drehmal a much more definitive ending, adding significantly to the end-game sequence and concretely determining the fate of the world. <br>
        - The player's starting location was changed from a tomb where the player mysteriously awakens to a temporal [[Stasis Facility|stasis facility]]. In turn, the player character's identity, previously not established, was solidified as a member of the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Avsohm/Stasis_Eight/), significant remnants of the empire of [[Avsohm]]. <br>
        - The [[Av'Sal Repository]] was added, and the hilt of the [[Mythbreaker]] was moved there. <br>
        - The current acquisition method of the Mythbreaker was implemented, splitting it into three parts, with the two blade fragments being located at the 25% and 50% locations. <br>
        - 25%: Added holotexts and the temporal engine puzzle to [[Sal'Mevir]]. <br>
        - 50%: Reworked the [[Exodus Citadel]], adding the rune circuit puzzle and the entirety of the underground [[Exodus Vault]], the true location of the new 50% event. Changed the S21 series of shields from legendaries into artifacts. <br>
        - 75%: Added the [[Admin Wing]] of the Repository, and the [[Aphelion]]. The Aphelion did not exist at all in 2.1. <br>
        - Post-75%: Added the entirety of [[Lo'Dahr]]. The terrain of the Lo'Dahr dimension, its custom structures and mobs, and its role in the story, did not exist prior to 2.2. The majority of references to Lo'Dahr in the overworld were also not present in previous versions. <br>
        - Yav: Changed the method of entry for [[Mt. Yavhlix]] and the [[Primary Energy Collection Facility]]. In previous versions, the door could only be opened by pressing a button outside of the door after reaching 100% tower linkage (not including the tower inside the facility itself). In 2.2, this is replaced by the Mythbreaker Run sequence, in which players must charge the [[Mythbreaker#Inert Mythbreaker|Inert Mythbreaker]] at the [[Numencore]], then escape the attacks of an angered [[Khive]] to break down the door. The Mythbreaker Run does not require any specific tower percentage to initiate, meaning that 2.2 can be beaten without reaching 100% towers. The "[[Mt. Yavhlix Dialogue|dialogue]]" in the facility is also a 2.2 addition. <br>
        - Post-Yav: Completely rewrote all of [[yellow|The Mythoclast]]'s dialogue, and added new sections at the end of the end-game (previously referred to as the "post-game"). This begins with the repurposing of the "Divine Ruins" at the Sunken Astral Body, which were turned into [[Azimuth Labs]], the site of the new God Machine. The [[Resonant Halls]] also received a large expansion and more explicit lore/story relevance. The entrance to the [[Court of Nothing]] was moved to the Stasis Facility, after the acquisition of the True Mythbreaker rather than just before it. The entire [[Maddened Path]] and [[True End]] sequences are new additions in 2.2. <br>
    ??? info "Fabled Equipment"
        Drehmal 2.2 added and changed several [legendary](/Items/Legendary_Items/) and [mythical](/Items/Mythical_Weapons/) pieces of gear. The 15 new legendaries are: <br>
        - [[Aeongale]] <br>
        - [[AvPOD]] <br>
        - [[Eldermead]] <br>
        - [[Eyebiter]] <br>
        - [[Festering Strides]] <br>
        - [[Magestep]] <br>
        - [[Parenchyma]] <br>
        - [[Penumbra]] <br>
        - [[Proxigea]] <br>
        - [[Pure Corruption]] <br>
        - [[Stasis Bolt]] <br>
        - [[Thundercrux]] <br>
        - [[Tul'Vohaln]] <br>
        - [[Warp Horse]] <br>
        - [[Whispersong]] <br>
        The two new mythical weapons added are [[Zenith]] (in the [[Foundry]]) and [[Syzygy]] (as a reward for completing the [Trials](/World/Late-Game/Points_of_Interest/Trials/)). <br>
        The start of the quest for [[Oblivion]] was moved to [[Highfall]], with the Compass of Nihility previously being found beneath the Tidal Palace in [[Firteid]]. <br>
    ??? abstract "New (Non-Story) Content"
        2.2 adds many new settlements and other points of interest, many of which are listed below. <br>
        - The moon of [[Lo'Dahr]] was added as a secondary, late-game open world, contained within its own entirely new dimension. Every town and point of interest on Lo'Dahr—including the likes of [[Ytaj]], [[Naharja]], [[Greyspire Castle]], and the [[Numencore]]—is new in 2.2. <br>
        - Almost all [interactions with dialogue](/Lore/Transcripts/) were introduced in 2.2, including dialogue from [[Maelihs]] and [[Drehmal]] (the latter somewhat indirectly).
        - The city of [[Rhaveloth]], the first official town inhabited by [[Maelmari]], was added in [[The Carmine]]. <br>
        - Large points of interest such as [[Teiruun Monastery]], [[Ancehl Castle]] (built over what used to be a nondescript ruin), [[Shatterhorn Gulch]], the [[Black Jungle#Black Ruins|Black Jungle Ruins]], [[Xor'Huul]], [[Drehua Temple]], [[Foundry|The Foundry]], [[Caer Adacia]], [[Star-Rise Bastion]], [[Wokonori]], and more. <br>
        - Smaller settlements, including: [[Schlonko]], the [[ICS Arbiter]], [[Elvett]], [[Tahva]], [[Port Solitude]], [[Thesund]], [[Solvei]], [[Morah]], [[Helmshire]], and [[Marahza]]. <br>
    ??? success "Updated Locations"
        2.2 updates several pre-existing structures and towns within the world, expanding towns to cities and giving ruins new life. Some of the most prominent updated areas include: <br>
        - [[Av'Sal]], which was previously contained to only the central island in 2.1, and did not exist at all in 2.0. The [[Av'Sal Repository|Repository]], as well as all of the content on the land surrounding the lake, are new to 2.2. <br>
        - [[Firteid]] has been overhauled from a modest-sized town to the largest city in the map by far. <br>
        - [[Highfall]] received a full makeover, moving the [[Frozen Bite#Grimm Troupe|Grimm Troupe]] to its own location outside of the town and adding more buildings to the eastern outskirts. <br>
        - [[Okeke]] was expanded with houses to the east and docks to the north. <br>
        - The [[Burnt Palace]] and [[Kiln of Virtuo]] were both fully re-built and greatly expanded. <br>

### 2.2.1 Changes

Version 2.2.1 made very few real content changes, mainly focusing on being a serviceable port of the map to Minecraft 1.20.1. This port was done by new developer tworoundcats, with some small content additions from the Drehmal team.

While the port to 1.20 does mean that blocks can now be placed as low as y=-64 and as high as y=324, this ability is not utilized in any new builds, cave systems, or other terrain features. Almost all major builds exist exactly as they were in the initial full release, with a few small exceptions.

Read the official changelog for 2.2.1 [here](https://www.drehmal.net/post/drehmal-apotheosis-v2-2-1-changelog).

### 2.2.2 Changes

Version 2.2.2 aims to serve as a polished final product of Drehmal: Apotheosis, seeking to fix almost all of the existing text errors and bugs in the map. It also adds a small amount of content, including a new secret advancement tied to a [[Aphelion|late-game story area]], three new [[artifacts]], an upgrade for the [[Artisan Items#Grimm Troupe|Nail]] artisan item, textures for a few select artifacts, and more.

The `doLimitedCrafting` gamerule is set to `true` by default in this version.
