## Transcription
> Many of my good friends among the La'Tehrmari were mortal-born among Koh covens on the remote Islands of Dusk and Dawn, but recently, the denizens of a lofty monastery on the Island of Dawn have chosen to convert to the faith of Rihelma. I would caution against visiting, however, since even our most experienced Wingmakers were forced to flee without managing to take a step inside. The denizens' short-sightedness is hilariously ironic.
