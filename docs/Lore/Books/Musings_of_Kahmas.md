## Transcription
> At first, the differences between Emperor Drehn and Emperor Anyr are blinding. Drehn was a peaceful ruler, chosen by the people. Anyr was a great general, chosen by a committee. While Drehn was eternally humble, Anyr is proud and ostentatious.
>
> And yet, the two are alike in aspiration. Both have relentlessly sought to expand the Empire's borders and improve the lives of its citizens. Both invested substantially in science and the military. Both had limitless ambition and have sought eternal life. I was one of few alive today who was born when Emperor Drehn still reigned, and while I do count myself lucky to still be kicking during the Anyr era, I am growing increasingly weary of constant escalation.
>
> Avsohm already controls most of the livable parts of this realm, and its citizens are prosperous and happier than ever. In my youth, the drive to push boundaries and do great new things for Blue Exodus and Avsohm helped me survive that distant war. Now, however, I cannot see why the empire will not rest on what it has built. Perhaps Emperor Ifeihl was not as foolish as most thought.
>
> All of this said, I have pledged my soul to this country, and if the Emperor wills it, I shall not rest unless the sky falls down and the world ends.
