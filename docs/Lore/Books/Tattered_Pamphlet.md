## Transcription
> Workers of Semehol! For too long we have been oppressed by the Maelmari, lording over us from the vile Hellcrags. History has proven that freedom is only won with struggle, so struggle we shall! Society has been split up into two great hostile camps, poised against each other, and the tension must eventually break! And when this break occurs, we, the humble workers and citizens of Semehol, must win the day. We must fight valiantly against the Maelmari, and liberate our homeland. A spark of revolution here would incite all of Tharhan into revolt; a glorious, bright, and burning revolution!
