# Dahr

**Dahr** is the Aspect of the Sea, and one of four Elder Aspects alongside [[Khive]], [[Rihelma]], and [[Taihgel]]. He is among the strongest of the Aspects, ruling over the seas as well as the divine moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], the home of the Aspects.

## Description

Dahr's passage in [[Theogony Volume II]] reads:

> Abyssal Elder Dahr, Great Sea Aspect
> ***
> Dahr brought water to the realm and filled the ocean basins. He is considered the King of the Aspects, and lords over the Prismatic Council, the governing body of the mysterious land which the Aspects call home: The moon of Lo'Dahr.

Dahr is often portrayed as being authoritative, boisterous, and proud, keeping a strong rule over his domain but remaining relatively humble and approachable to the other Aspects. 

Dahr takes a unique physical form resembling a colossal sea serpent with the head of a sperm whale, the hood of a king cobra, and a long, eel-like body, as well as two arms.

### Color/Build Scheme

Dahr is very heavily associated with the color blue, and Dahr-related builds often make heavy use of the cyan and light blue colors in particular. Builds associated with Dahr are usually themed around the ocean, often using lots of prismarine, quartz, and coral structures.

## Role

Dahr was responsible for the creation of the oceans of Drehmal, bringing the first water to the realm. 

He was also responsible for the creation of the moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], initially creating the moon as a vast warm ocean for his own mortal subjects. The other Aspects would eventually move to Lo'Dahr, changing its landscapes significantly, but as the ruler of the moon, Dahr has retained the title of King of Lo'Dahr, and by extension, the leader of the Prismatic Council of the Aspects.

## Known History

Dahr is one of the Elder Aspects, the four most ancient Aspects created by the Primal Tree before the dawn of Av1. His initial task in the creation of the realm was filling the ocean basins of the [[disc]], and shortly afterward, he would go on to create the moon of Lo'Dahr.

Dahr and [[Rihelma]] together created their son, the [[Palaesida|Tempest Palaesida]], Aspect of Storms. [[Dahroehl]] is his child by himself.

## Devotion Guide

Dahr's [[devotion]] site is [[Port Solitude]], a small town of sailors on the southern shores of the desolated [[South Heartwood]].

Around Dahr's shrine, players can find low-level offerings such as ink sacs, tropical fish, and sea pickles. The [[Sea-Priest's Musings]] book provides the following hint:

> On a foggy day, I invite in any captain that arrives in port for a drink and a prayer. They're either a fellow saltblood who knows to place an offering to Dahr **on the prow of their ship**, or they're a living corpse who needs every bit of help they can get from a priest like me. Either way, it's a good time.

Hints as to higher-tier offerings are found at the front of several ships throughout the realm.

    Ships with Dahr devotion items on their prows can be found docked at: [[Mohta]], [[Tahva]], [[Port Solitude]], the [[Kiln of Virtuo]], [[Firteid]], and [[Mossfield]].

## Late-Game Info

--8<-- "spoiler.md"

--8<-- "LD_spoiler.md"

Dahr is a very important figure to Lo'Dahr, where much of the late-game takes place.

![[ytaj_statue_dahr.png]]

Dahr is referenced many times in [[Ytaj]], having a secondary devotion site and [[Ytaj#Dahr's Room|a large room]] in the palace complex. The statue pictured above is also found here, wielding a large trident.

[[Dahr's Domain]] is one of the largest biomes on the moon, encompassing a significant amount of the moon's southwest. Dahr offers one of the six [trials](/World/Late-Game/Points_of_Interest/Trials/) at the [[Abyssal Rise]] in this region, and his ancient challenge at [[Challenger's Grotto]] still waits to be completed.

The [[Proxigea]] legendary trident is also connected to Dahr's Av1 activities. It reads:

> In the First Avihm, a great empire of purity sought to kill Dahr and gain control of the oceans. Dahr saw this and knew they could not withstand the might of the sea itself. In a mocking gesture, the Abyssal Elder crafted this powerful trident and gifted it to the empire.

This "great empire of purity" was likely the [[Viruhn]], showcasing Dahr's brash and confident nature in engaging with what seems to have been an advanced civilization.
