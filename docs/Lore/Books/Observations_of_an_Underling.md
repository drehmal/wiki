## Transcription
> The Burnt Palace is in chaos. Lord Maelihs is enraged, consumed by a fury few in history have ever seen. Klyhf Him'lahk's tower has been completely leveled. Nothing remains but rubble. To think that our Lord's only confidant would betray him like this... it was unthinkable, to put it lightly.
>
> It has been a few days since Lord Maelihs tore down the tower of the Defiler. The ruins are still smoldering. Our Lord has stormed off to the North with the intent of pressing his advantage. Our strategists say that the capture of the entire West is now inevitable.
>
> Lord Maelihs has become even more closed off lately, no doubt still reeling in shock of the betrayal. It is... quite unbecoming of me to write this, but it is true. Even in the worst of times, jesters were able to get a chuckle out of Our Lord. But now, he is rarely seen outside of his bedroom.
