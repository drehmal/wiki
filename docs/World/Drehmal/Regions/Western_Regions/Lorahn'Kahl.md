# Hellcrags

![[Hellcrags1.webp]]{ align=right width="300" }

The **Hellcrags** are a region in the far southwest of [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. As alluded to by its name, the region has highly distinctive, hellish environment, reminiscent of the base-game Nether. In the lore, the Hellcrags are known as the deepest reaches of [[Maelihs|Maelihs's]] domain, being the home of the Burnt Lord himself.

## Geography

The Hellcrags are a circular peninsula secluded in the continent's southwestern corner, separated from [[The Carmine|the Carmine]] to the northeast by the [[Crimson Gorge]]. The floor of the ocean surrounding its other sides consists mostly of magma blocks, making it difficult to arrive by boat or swimming.

The region can be divided into three layers. The outer layer, lining the coast, is comprised of land with ground made of gray sand, and cliffs containing black, gray and red stone. The terrain slopes upward as it progresses inward, and then drops off into the lower middle layer. The ground here is composed of mainly taihryte (netherrack) with spots of magma and soul sand. The land is cut through by many lava trenches lined with obsidian, black sand, and ores (redstone, quartz, gold, and diamond). This area is also scattered with tentacle-like structures and gargantuan bones, and orange crags ring the interior. The innermost layer is a large lava lake, at the center of which stands the [[Burnt Palace]]. It should be noted that because of the region's technical configuration as a Nether biome along with its open skies, extreme numbers of ghasts can spawn at the same time. For this reason, the Hellcrags are a very dangerous area, and it is advised that players keep cover when mining.

**Environmental Sub-Regions:**
- Outer rim with gray sand and black, gray and red striped cliffs
- Middle layer with taihryte floor and lava trenches

There are no settlements in the Hellcrags.

## History

The origin of the region's firey conditions are unknown, but it was likely settled by Maehlis when his Burnt Palace was constructed here in the early Second Avihm. From here, he expanded and ruled his [[Empire of Maehlis|empire]] for millenia to come.

Although the region as of yet has never been touched by any power opposing Maelihs, it came closest to being conquered by the [[Insohm|Insohmic Coalition]] during the [[Battle for Drehmal]], when their armies pushed as far as the Carmine.

## [[Terminus Network|Terminus Tower]]

The Hellcrags' Terminus tower sits amid a lava lake in the region's west. It is surrounded on four sides by obsidian spikes about half the tower's height, protruding upward and inward. There are no hostile entities present.

## Points of Interest

### Burnt Palace

The Burnt Palace is a large fortress consisting of many interconnected towers and halls built on, into, and around a crag in the middle of the region's central lava lake. The structure is comprised mostly of blackstone, slate, and carnelian brick variants. It has served as Maelihs's home and seat of power ever since (presumably) the early Second Avihm. Although he himself is no longer present, the palace is still heavily guarded by [[Maelmari]] and filled with treasure.

### Titans of Strength and Servitude

The Titans of Strength and Servitude are two colossal blackstone statues flanking a pass in the Hellcrags' northeast, leading between the region's northeastern edge by the Crimson Gorge and the region's inner land layer. The colossus to the south depicts Maelihs, standing tall, holding his signature weapon [[Malevolentia]] in his left hand and sustaining a flame of chaos in his right hand. The northern statue is of a Maelmari servant, bowing before Maelihs and holding their hands in front, pressing their left hand, balled in a fist, into his right hand, held with its palm facing to the left. Beneath Maelihs's statue is a site for offerings.
