### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in an item frame in the Administrative Wing of the [[Av'Sal Repository]]. It contains both formal and informal logs of world events from an Avsohmic intelligence officer.

### Transcription:
> *This book is split into two columns; one is a formal draft, detailing events pertinent to global affairs, while the other is a margin, filled with scribbled notes and complaints of a more personal nature. The writing in the left column is flowing cursive, while the writing in the right is closer to scratch.*
>
> Section 450g-7:
> Regionalist terrorists bomb cross-mountain supply convoy, halting deliveries to Av'Sal for multiple days.
>
> Margins:
> Pricks delayed my melon shipment. Need to increase security between distribution centers. Ask Grovahn for more details later.
>
> Section 720t-8:
> Minor skirmish between Mihkmari raiders and a routine scouting party in South Tharxax. All raiders neutralized.
>
> Margins:
> A routine conflict, but the raiders were oddly equipped. Either they had stolen equipment, or Maelihs is supplying them.
>
> Section 850f-4:
> Hostile attack on the Foundry, all attackers repelled. Regionalists are suspected to be behind the attack.
>
> Margin:
> Another surprisingly well-armed attack, but this time by rogue Drehmari. Is Maelihs funding the Regionalist faction now? Absurd.
>
> *There are hundreds of reports in the same format; far too many to read through. They detail covert operations, diplomatic intrigue, and more. Terrorist attacks become more and more frequent as you read the later reports. Just how many enemies did the Avsohmic Empire have?*
