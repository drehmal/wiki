## Transcription
> The city-state of Ancehl was one of the largest and wealthiest places in Drehmal in the early days of Av2. Growing rich during the Deity War by famously not taking sides, its monarchs were begrudgingly respected and despised in equal measure. Even in those early days, there are records of a tunnel system beneath Akhlo'Rohma. Home to countless corpses, there are also secondary sources from Avsohm that suggest that the arts of alchemy were first theorized deep within by the wise nobles of Ancehl. Whatever secrets they may have hid in those days, it is certainly true that the tunnels grew in importance during the reign of Emperor Zorhis Ifeihl of Avsohm. In a ceremonial gesture after the capture of the serial killer known only as "Lake Man", part of the Crypts of Akhlo'Rohma became infamous as Avsohm's highest security prison.
>
> Legends of the Crypts would continue to resurface from time to time up until the present day, but two things seem to be likely:
>
> First, entrances to the tunnel network are increasingly few and far between. The last documented entry was buried in a landslide in Av3 301.
>
> Second, there are rumors of a magnificent treasure somewhere within the Crypts of Akhlo'Rohma. Up until now, however, would-be finders have had little luck finding their secrets.
>
> Only time will tell exactly what role history still has for these mysterious passages in one of the oldest cradles of civilization.
