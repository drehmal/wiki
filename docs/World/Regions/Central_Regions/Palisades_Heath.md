# Palisades Heath

![[PH_landscape.png]]{ align=right width="300" }

**Palisades Heath** is a region in central [[Overworld|Drehmal]]. The region is characterized by its deep fjords and rocky highlands. The region makes up most of the Mouth of Drehmal's west coast.

## Geography

Palisades Heath lies between the Gulf of Drehmal to the east and the Burnt Mountains to the east (with [[South Tharxax]] on the other side). To the north is [[Capital Valley]] (specifically the city of [[Av'Sal]]) and to the south is the [[South Heartwood]].

Most of Palisades Heath is divided into three large plateaus by two rivers that run west-east, plus two more; one separating the region from Capital Valley in the north and one separating the southernmost plateau from the south lowlands. These plateau-shaped landforms have steep, white-and-gray striped cliffs that drop off into the surrounding rivers and sea. The same striped pattern is prevalent throughout many of the region's rocky surfaces. The two central rivers run off from glaciers flowing from the Burnt Mountains, out to the Mouth of Drehmal. The northernmost of these two is likely named the Erwu. The region's land is mostly plains, but there are some spruce and oak woods, mostly in the eastern half.

## History

Palisades Heath was one of the first (possibly *the* first) habitable areas created by Drehmal after the Felling of the [[Primal Tree]]. At the time, the land was referred to by the [[Rihselch]] name "Palisahd". The Drehmal-worshiping [[Ancient Drehua]] people emerged in this region, founding [[Drehua Temple]]. Recorded history first began at this temple through the writing of monks, documenting early history through interactions with their patron deity. Four of these accounts are found at the temple, referred to as "Parables," written by monks who would become important, even prophetic figures for the Drehua people.

Later in the Second Avihm, the region would fall under the rule of the [[Avsohm|Avsohmic Empire]]. The first emperor, [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]], had an interest in the Drehuan culture, and was responsible for the refurbishment of Drehua Temple and many old Drehuan works of art. The region had also become a hotspot for pirates who raided the coasts along the Mouth of Drehmal, and they continued to inhabit the region during Avsohm's reign.

Little is known about the region's history in the Third Avihm, but its reputation of outlaws continues to stand until this day.

Today, the only remaining settlement of notable size is Drehua Temple, still populated by devotees of the serpent. [[Drehmal]] is worshipped by the region's people.

## Terminus Tower

The Palisades Heath [[Terminus Network#Towers|Terminus tower]] is located in the region's north, next to the main road. It stands inside a pit with a partially frozen lake at the bottom. A bridge juts out from the edge of the pit and ends in front of the tower's midsection. No hostile entities are present.

## Points of Interest

### Drehua Temple

[[Drehua Temple]] is a large, ornate temple dedicated to the deity [[Drehmal]]. It contains living quarters for monks, several ancient books and Drehmal's [[Devotion|devotion]] altar. The temple was founded by the ancient Drehua, but it was renovated more than a millennium later with funds from the Avsohmic emperor Drehn Mal'Sohm.

### Drehuan Sculptures

In the north of the region, off the side of the road in a patch of woods, there is a group of large ancient Drehuan stone sculptures and other small structures. The largest by far, overlooking the rest, is a statue of a bald [[Drehmari]] sitting cross-legged with one palm held outward and a four-pronged staff in the other hand. 

The [[Artifacts#Drehuan Macrochisel|Drehuan Macrochisel artifact]] is found here.

### Friendly Fellow's Humble Abode

On the northern portion of the region, east of the Terminus tower, a small blackstone hill can be found. A pond within this hill holds a small cabin, with a sign that labels it "Friendly Fellow's Humble Abode." Inside, a skeleton named "The Funny Man", who cannot hurt the player, is found, along with a [[Runic Catalyst]].
