# Homli Tahsgan

**Homli Tahsgan** (pronounced "home-lee taz-gan") was a hero of the [[Faehrcyle|Faehrcylian]] Falcon Clan, and possibly a [[Potentia#People/Souls|Savant]]. Homli was the leader of a combined effort by Faehrcylian Tribes to deny [[Avsohm]] access to [[Mt. Yavhlix]], a task that he briefly succeeded in by summoning a colossal, magical blizzard. This event and its impact would come to be known as the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], an ecological disaster that affected nearly a quarter of [[Overworld|Drehmal]].

## History

Homli's story is told by [[The Epic of Homli Tahsgan]], in the format of an epic poem from the perspective of the Faehrcylians. 

Homli was born to Gehmli Tahsgan, the leader of the Faehrcylian Falcon Clan. At a young age, Homli was massive and incredibly strong, supposedly slaying a bear and wearing its hide while he was still a child. As a young man, Homli left home for some unknown reason, answering a "call from far away", and disappeared for two years.

During the time that Homli was away, [[Drehn|Drehn Mal'Sohm]] and an Avsohmic army approached Faehrcyle, seeking passage to Mt. Yavhlix. Sensing their ill intentions, Gehmli and Falcon Clan denied them passage, turning the Empire back south.

After two years of roaming the lands, Homli returned home, just in time to meet an Avsohmic army led by the rogue General Hehvlar in battle. Based on the Epic, Homli seems to have exhibited magical abilities even at this point, sending forth blasts of cold wind with his sword strikes and cutting down Avsohm's ranks, even with the Empire's superior technology. This battle ended with Gehmli dying to an Avsohmic archer, triggering Homli to let forth a scream that blew an eastward wind which scared Avsohm into retreating. This was likely a limited act of Divine Magic which Homli harnessed through his Savant capabilities, in a moment of extremely heightened emotion.

Per the Epic, all of Faehrcyle mourned Gehmli's death. Homli, now the head of Falcon Clan, decided that all seven Faehrcylian clans would need to unite to push back these southern invaders, and reportedly procured a sword of pure ice from his father's funeral pyre, stunning those in attendance into pledging their support for his cause.

However, late-game sources concerning the [[Divine Schism]] paint a different picture. Rather, it seems to be the case that this sword, the [[Frostfang]], was gifted to Homli by [[Palaesida]], after the Aspect of Storms stole it from its mythical forge.

In the final conflict, armed with the Frostfang, Homli never actually met the forces of Avsohm. Rather, he simply lifted the sword to the sky, and conjured up the same magic that he had the first time. Now, armed with an extremely powerful implement, Homli created a storm with incredibly powerful gusts, lightning, and hail, which grew and grew in size until it eventually enveloped several northern regions. Avsohm was pushed back, but Homli, having used too much power, sank to a knee and was engulfed by the snow. 

Homli had succeeded in pushing Avsohm away, but the region of Faehrcyle was now covered in an eternal layer of snow, making it unlivable for the clans. His body was never found.

## Appearance

Homli is described as a behemoth of a [[Drehmari]], standing "eight feet tall and four feet wide" as described by the Epic. He had a mane of golden blonde hair for most of his life, which changed to white when he first used his powers to repel the Avsohmic invaders.

## Legacy

While he is still celebrated as a hero by some descendants of the Faehrcylian tribes, Homli was a very controversial figure outside of the north. While some viewed him as a righteous warrior who was pushed into his actions by an oppressive imperial power, others blame him alone for the Frostfang Catastrophe and the destruction of his own homeland (and beyond).

Regardless, Homli is still remembered in the realm today.

## Extras

Based on the [[(REMOVED) Calendar of Drehmal|removed calendar book]], Homli's last name may be [[Rihselch]] for "cold".
