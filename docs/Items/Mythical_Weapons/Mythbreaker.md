**The Mythbreaker** is one of 8 Mythical Weapons obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Central to the main story of Drehmal, Mythbreaker was forged over a thousand years ago by the fallen Empire of [[Avsohm]], among their greatest advancements. Avsohm believed the spear to be unknowably powerful, capable of storing and delivering effectively infinite levels of [[Primal Energy]].

Re-creating the spear and learning how to use it is a core aspect of Drehmal's [[Story Progression|story]]. Multiple versions of the Mythbreaker exist in-game, but must be unlocked progressively over the course of the game.

All versions of the Mythbreaker are actually a warped fungus on a stick, heavily modified through NBT commands.

## Inert Mythbreaker
The Inert Mythbreaker is the first version of the Mythbreaker that the player can obtain. 

| Category | Description                 |
|:--------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stats**                            | -4 Max Health (-2 Hearts) <br> -0.015 Movement Speed <br> 18 Attack Damage <br> 0.5 Attack Speed      |
| **Ability**                          | N/A |
| **Lore**                             | While perfect in form, it is clear that the weapon lacks something. A blade with such infinite potential should not go to waste. |
| **Obtain**                           | Assembled by the player at the Av'Sal Repository through main story progression, with fragments found at Sal'Mevir and Exodus Vault.  |

### Gameplay
Inert Mythbreaker deals significant damage, but its movement speed/max health penalties and very slow attack speed, combined with its complete lack of a special ability, make it a rather unenticing choice for regular combat.

### How to Obtain
Finding the pieces of the Inert Mythbreaker is the player's main story goal in the 25% and 50% completion events, at [[Sal'Mevir]] and the [[Exodus Vault]], respectively. When obtained, these pieces can be reunited at the [[Av'Sal Repository]].

![[inertmb_ig.png]]
> The completed Inert Mythbreaker, at the Av'Sal Repository.

The Inert Mythbreaker can be charged up in order to power it further, which is learned initially from a [[avsal_mythbreaker2.md|holotext]] near the hilt. The method through which this is done is learned later in the story, past the 75% mark.

### Lore
!!! warning "Be advised: the lore contained in this section references discoveries from far after the player can first assemble the spear."

!!! warning "These discoveries may constitute end-game spoilers. Proceed with caution."

The Inert Mythbreaker is the version of the spear created by [[Avsohm]] in the late Second Avihm, after they learned of the nature of the universe through the Resonant Eye. Through that device, the empire was able to make out the shape of what they thought was a spear, and began work on re-creating this spear from their data.

[[Misc Avsohm#Kovis|Kovis]], a member of [[Blue Exodus]] with significant expertise in the field of graviton theory, was central to the process of turning the data from the Eye into real schematics, and the blade was first forged at the Graviton Crucible in the [[Exodus Vault]].

It appears to have been split into three parts somewhat shortly after its creation as a failsafe, being spread out into three of Avsohm's most secure Research & Development locations across the continent. It was made evident in testing that the blade was capable of storing incredible, nearly infinite amounts of [[Primal Energy]].

Avsohm's ultimate goal with the blade was to charge it using a massive source of Primal Energy, then use it to tear a hole in the [[Veil]], allowing them to peer outward into the cosmos and continue to expand their empire beyond the natural border of the realm. However, Avsohm was never able to get around one issue: how to charge the weapon. Using the source at [[Mt. Yavhlix]] was out of the question, as it would draw so much power that the entire Avsohmic energy grid would collapse, and so other sources had to be explored...(continued in Charged Mythbreaker section)

## Charged Mythbreaker

!!! danger "This section contains significant spoilers for a late-game area unlocked after the 75% completion event."

!!! danger "Unless you have FINISHED the 75% Completion sequence, **ALL THE WAY THROUGH TO THE "Apotheosis" ADVANCEMENT**, we strongly advise that you **DO NOT** continue to read this article, as this **will** interfere with your ability to discover crucial aspects of the map for yourself."

!!! danger "Additionally, this section is concerned with a story location at this late-game area. If you have not yet discovered and completed the Numencore (as denoted by the "Apex of Divinity" and "No Fear" advancements, respectively), this page will contain spoilers for content you have not seen."

The Charged Mythbreaker (simply named "Mythbreaker" in-game) is the upgraded version of the Mythbreaker, charged with the [[Primal Energy]] of the [[Numencore]].

| Category | Description                 |
|:--------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stats**                            | -4 Max Health (-2 Hearts) <br> 150 Ability Damage <br> 27 Attack Damage <br> 0.7 Attack Speed      |
| **Ability**                          | **Core Collapse**: "*Hold down right click for an extended period to collapse the innumerable possibilities before you into an impossibly strong blast of primal energy.*" <br> If successfully used without being interrupted, this ability can deal up to 150 damage, although this can be difficult to pull off. <br> **Cooldown:** 60s (shortened to 15-45s if interrupted mid-use). |
| **Lore**                             | Seemingly infinite power arcs across this blade, burning your hands and quaking the ground beneath your feet. It seems as if reality itself wavers as the rawest form of existence seeps into the space around you. |
| **Obtain**                           | Acquired by charging the Inert Mythbreaker at the [[Numencore]].  |

### Gameplay
The charged variant of the Mythbreaker is markedly more powerful than its inert counterpart, and ditches the pale yellow color for a bright, vibrant yellow. This specific version of the Mythbreaker can only be obtained temporarily, as part of the [[Story Progression#Mythbreaker Run (LATE-GAME SPOILERS BEGIN HERE)|Mythbreaker run]]. It has 100 durability, which gradually drains over time (losing 1 durability roughly every 4-5 seconds), reverting back to the Inert form if its durability reaches zero.

![[core_collapse_fp.gif]]{ width="600" } 

![[core_collapse_tp.gif]]

This form of the spear has increased base damage, no movement speed, and the Core Collapse ability, making it much more powerful, although it is somewhat hindered by the specific circumstances under which it can be acquired. The Core Collapse ability allows the player to fire a devastating beam of energy forward over the span of approximately 10 seconds, dealing up to 150 damage over the course of its trajectory. This beam does not point directly forward, but rather, sprays out in multiple directions centered around the spear, making it difficult to maximize the beam's damage unless directly in front of an enemy, or aiming at a large group of enemies.

It seems that the durability damage to this Mythbreaker causes the Core Collapse ability to be interrupted, making it difficult to complete this attack during its designated sequence. However, the cooldown time for the ability is shortened to as little as 15 seconds if the player does not fully complete the attack.

It is also a known bug that Core Collapse may not be able to fire if the player has something else in their offhand, such as a shield.[^1]

Using the Charged Mythbreaker for its intended purpose at the end of the run will successfully finish the sequence, unlocking a late-game area and removing the weapon from the player's inventory.

### How to Obtain
The Charged Mythbreaker is, as implied by its name, obtained by charging the Inert version of the spear forged at the [[Av'Sal Repository]]. Doing so is the primary goal of the story after the 75% milestone. For a full guide on learning how to access the Mythbreaker charging station, see [[Core Facility]].

![[numencore_core_charged.png]]
> The Charged Mythbreaker in the Numencore's charging station.

After the player has accessed the Numencore, a colossal reserve of Primal Energy, they can flip two override switches to allow access to the charging station. Placing the Inert Mythbreaker on the station by right-clicking will initiate a charging sequence, which will turn the weapon into its charged variant, which can be picked up by right-clicking again.

### Lore
The Charged Mythbreaker does not exist in the realm of Drehmal until the player charges it at the Numencore, but plans to do so were in place long before the map's main story plays out.

As charging the Mythbreaker on the main Avsohmic power grid would result in a potentially catastrophic collapse of the empire's infrastructure, a secondary source had to be located. The [[Aphelion]]'s scanners picked up a massive source of Primal Energy seemingly within the moon of [[LD|Lo'Dahr]], and Avsohm pursued this lead to the Numencore. A full research station at the site was built, as well as a small station to charge the Mythbreaker. This site was nearly used, but a last-second concern from [[Misc Avsohm#Marto|Marto]] gave the empire reason to halt the operation. It was determined that the empire was not ready to potentially anger [[Khive]], the owner of the Numencore, by siphoning energy from it, and the plan was put on indefinite hold.

The empire fell before they had the chance to see their greatest weapon at its full potential.

## True Mythbreaker

!!! danger "WARNING!!! This section contains EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT spoilers for end-game areas (after the Mt. Yavhlix sequence)."

!!! danger "If you have not **FINISHED THE MAIN STORY OF THE MAP IN ITS ENTIRETY**, we strongly recommend that you DO NOT read the contents of this article."

!!! danger "Note: The true end of the storyline will take you to a dedicated credits room, NOT the vanilla Minecraft end credits."

The final version of the spear, named "The Mythbreaker" in-game and sometimes referred to within the community as the "True Mythbreaker," is the weapon's strongest known form.

| Category | Description                 |
|:--------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stats**                            | -4 Max Health (-2 Hearts) <br> 250 Ability Damage <br> 27 Attack Damage <br> 0.7 Attack Speed      |
| **Enchantments**                     | Sharpness X |
| **Ability**                          | **Core Collapse**: "*Hold down right click for an extended period to collapse the innumerable possibilities before you into an ultimate ray of death.*" <br> **Cooldown:** 60s (shortened to 15-45s if interrupted mid-use). |
| **Lore**                             | In the endless cosmos beyond the veil, there exists the primordial battle between fundamental forces. Trillions of realms, held together by the hopeful defiance of entropy, ultimately nothing more than a balancing act in the face of inevitable, muted chaos. Those that fight to control it always forfeit their right to existence. |
| **Obtain**                           | Progress to the [[Court of Nothing]] sequence in the end-game.  |

### Gameplay
The True Mythbreaker is functionally identical to the Charged Mythbreaker in terms of gameplay features, with two notable exceptions. First, the ability damage for Core Collapse is increased significantly, from 150 to 250. Second, the weapon is enchanted with Sharpness X (double the regular vanilla limit of Sharpness V), which gives it an extra 5.5 base damage.

The True Mythbreaker does not disappear upon use of its Core Collapse ability anywhere.

??? warning "Late-Game Spoilers: Upgrades"
    The True Mythbreaker is the spear's only variant that can be upgraded with one of each Fervor Stone at the Soletta, increasing its health, cooldown, and movement speed bonuses. A fully upgraded Mythbreaker has no max health penalty, grants +0.01 Movement Speed, and has a special ability cooldown of 45 seconds.

### How to Obtain
![[truemb_ig.png]]
> The True Mythbreaker as it initially appears in-game.

The True Mythbreaker is presented to the player during the return to the [[Stasis Facility]] in the end-game. It can be picked up normally, by right-clicking.

### Lore
This version of the Mythbreaker is presented to the player directly by [[yellow|The Mythoclast]], just before entering the [[Court of Nothing]]. Like its creator (and the vast majority of the lore surrounding Drehmal's end-game), its exact nature is unclear, although it is almost certain that this spear is not the truest form of the weapon, more akin to a replica created by an incredibly powerful being.

The weapon itself may or may not even truly exist, as hinted at by the Mythoclast's [[End-Game_Dialogue.md|dialogue]]. If the mural of the Mythoclast is to be taken literally (which is suggested to not be the case), then the spear may actually be the tail of the Mythoclast himself, which Avsohm saw and misinterpreted as a spearhead. Even this may be an oversimplification, as the Mythoclast may not even have a true form. However, it does appear that the being and the weapon are fundamentally connected somehow, as the name "Mythoclast" can be literally interpreted as "Mythbreaker," with the root "-clast" meaning "to break."
