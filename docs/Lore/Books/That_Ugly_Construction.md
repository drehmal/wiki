## Transcription
> The Preceptor has long preached about not journeying to the massive cavern to the south. Like we don't know what's there. That massive, ugly construction from our past invaders.
>
> My brother is all too curious to find out what it was for. Don't know why. They all disappeared long before we were born. I say he should just listen to the Preceptor and stay away.
