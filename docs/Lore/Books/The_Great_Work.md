## Transcription
> The Great Work is the dream of any Alchemist worth the name, a masterpiece in which they have poured so much of themselves that it is no less than an extension of their existence. To wield Divine Magic with the same ease as Gods and Aspects... It is, in a word, Apotheosis.
>
> Little is known about the Great Work, and there are only two facts upon which most Alchemists agree: <br>
> 1) As an extension of their being, the Great Work is unique to every alchemist. <br>
> 2) There are only two known completions of the Great Work, the First Necromancer and the Lord of Dust.
>
> All else is Conjecture.
> 
> Many have come close to completion of the Work: Klyhf Him'lahk, the Defiler; Jabim, the Broken Thing; Hish of the Rising Smoke. All have failed, for one reason or another. Even the great Avsohmic Empire collapsed with nothing to show of themselves.
>
> To achieve this feat is to carve your name into the world itself, a scar that will forever fester and rot.
