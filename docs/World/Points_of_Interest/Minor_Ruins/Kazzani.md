    Approximate Coordinates: `1797, 97, 3252`

Kazzani sits atop a hill, next to the large lake that feeds into the Twinrock River to the west.

## Layout

A lightly worn trail that forks off to the south from the road west of [[Gozak]] leads to Kazzani, entering at its northern gate.

Buildings in the north appear more unique, often incorporating mushrooms into their designs. Some of these were used for growing crops.

Toward the south, more Avsohmic buildings are found, switching to a more uniform color palette including quartz, diorite, and blue/light blue terracotta. The largest of these buildings, overlooking the Desolation to the south, has the [[Ihb's Letter Home]] book on its upper floor.

Treehouses interconnected by bridges also span over the entire town. A treehouse back towards the north was the former home of [[Devro Ihb]], as evidenced by the [[Artifacts#Sea Legs|Sea Legs]] artifact and [[Memoir of Devro Ihb]] book inside.

## Lore

Kazzani was once a relatively prosperous town in the mid-late Second Avihm, flourishing under the rule of [[Avsohm]]. It was the hometown of renowned sailor [[Devro Ihb]], and the children there were among the many fans of his novels.

Kazzani itself does not appear to have been destroyed outright by the Desolation of the [[South Heartwood]], as the dense forest around it is still alive, but it certainly would have been impacted in some way. This is likely around the time that its residents would have left for other towns.
