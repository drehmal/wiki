### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in an item frame in an old Avsohmic ship wrecked in [[Nimahj Swamp]], pondering on the location of one of the ship's crewmembers who left to find help at the [[Exodus Citadel]]. The coordinates mentioned in the book as Dahmar's last known location point players to a chest and small tomb-like structure with a skeleton head.
