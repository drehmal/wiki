## Location/Summary
This book can be found in a chest in the [[Rehntite Cave]]. It provides some insight into the nature of rehntite, and its importance to the [[Empire of Avsohm]].

## Transcription
> It cannot be overstated just how "lucky" we are to have found this cavern and the Yavhlix energy source in the span of just a few years.
>
> Among all minerals, rehntite has the highest potentia by far. It isn't really even close. Before discovering Mine #1, we were under the impression that it was also among the rarest minerals in the realm.
>
> In order for runic magic to work, one needs three things. The first is some material to carve the rune upon. Rehntite is ideal for its high and predictable level of potentia.
>
> The second is the rune itself. To carve the very hard rehntite, we need crystals only found on the Islands of Dusk and Dawn. Of course, Avsohm already controlled those seas when the cave was found.
>
> The third is a source of energy. For most of history, the amount of energy capable of being added to a rune was thought to have an upper limit. But Yavhlix changed all of that. By injecting Primal Energy into a rune, we could supercharge runes to unprecedented levels.
>
> That's why discovering this cave and starting Mine #1 was such an important development.
>
> Suddenly, under  Emperor Drehn Mal'Sohm, every facet of life started to improve. We developed micro-runes, primal catalysts, and the rest is history. If it was a coincidence, it was a mighty coincidence indeed. I am more partial to the view that Drehn Mal'Sohm was the descendant of Prophet Shirua, and that the Serpent's spirit within his body guided him to send the survey drones to Akhlo'Rohma.
>
> Why else would such a large deposit exist if Drehmal had not created it Themselves? Certainly, Koh or Khive could have had a hand in the cave's initial creation and the power of rehntite, respectively, but analysis of the rock layers makes it clear that this region was heavily spliced by Drehmal following the Felling.
>
> It's important to recognize just how fortunate we are to work here. I never let the new recruits forget. This is a place of miracles, just as much as the Kiln of Virtuo! It's just a lot dirtier.
