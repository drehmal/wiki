# Rihselch

**Rihselch** (pronounced "rice-elch") is an ancient language in Drehmal, spoken by the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) and presumably by the people of the First Avihm. Many of the original names of individuals and places in Drehmal are of Rihselch origin, although it is not widely spoken except by scholars in the modern day.

## History

Rihselch appears to be the original spoken and written language of the realm, as it is referred to as "ancient" even in [[Shirua's Teachings]], a book written in very early Av2.

Rihselch was phased out in favor of Common, a generic lingua franca which simply appears as English in the map for the sake of simplicity.

As of the time of [[Avsohm]], Rihselch was still known by linguists and scholars, and was likely spoken by the [Aspects](/Lore/Higher_Beings/Aspects/) amongst themselves.

## Used Terms

A few terms, roots, and expressions from Rihselch are used in the map, and have relatively clear meanings. This is very far from a full language, and parts may not be fully canon (1), but the following list provides some ideas:
