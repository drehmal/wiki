## Description { data-search-exclude }

![[palaesida_domain.png]]

**Palaesida's Domain** is one of 14 Aspect Domains on [[Lo'Dahr]], belonging to the deceased Aspect of Storms, Tempest [[Palaesida]]. This region was once a sea, but since its patron's death, has dried and blackened, eventually being consumed by an eternal storm after his bones arose from their resting place. (1) The region sits just southeast of the geographic center of Lo'Dahr's habitable area, bordering [[Dahr's Domain]] to the west, [[Nahyn's Domain]] to the north, [[Rihelma's Domain]] to the east, and [[Voynahla's Domain]] to the south.

1. While Palaesida's Domain is intended to be consumed by this eternal storm, this is not well represented due to Minecraft's technical constraints, as all of the terrain is static in-game.

## Geography

Palaesida's Domain is a relatively small region, comprising part of a drained basin and a series of floating islands in the air, intended to represent a swirling storm. Small ponds can be found in the region, mostly where rivers from other regions directly feed into, but the majority of the region's ground level is rather barren and dry.

Several large geode-like structures can be found floating around the region, often containing either amethyst or diamond ore.

The entire region is centered around the Heart of the Tempest, a large orb of energy in the sky surrounded by swirling clouds (depicted by tinted glass).

## Gameplay

Chthonic Skeletons (vanilla Wither Skeletons) and Grey Pseudodragons spawn in Palaesida's Domain.

| **Description** | Custom Lightning Evokers, who spawn riding phantoms, also spawn in Palaesida's Domain, and patrol the skies. These mobs are capable of summoning a ring of lightning bolts around a player, in addition to the normal Evoker "fang" ground attack. These Evokers can be separated from their mounts by killing the phantom. These Evokers also do not appear to have the ability to summon Vex.  |

These enemies can make navigating through Palaesida's Domain extremely treacherous.

## History

Palaesida's Domain was once dominated by a large inland sea, fed by perpetual rainstorms that were maintained by its patron Aspect. However, the death of Palaesida at the conclusion of the [[Divine Schism]] led the region to a similar fate as [[Noha's Domain]], falling into disarray without its creator.

In the case of this region, the sea (which was shared with part of Rihelma's Domain to the east) eventually dried up without storms to replenish its water reserves, and Palaesida's corpse was interred in the center of his domain. At some point after his death, however, Palaesida's skeleton began to stir again, and a storm was formed around him. The piece of earth wherein he was buried became the Heart of the Tempest, with an even more violent, unending storm consuming the area. Today, the region is completely inhospitable.

Historically, this region was home to Okhran Prison, which appears to have been the main [[Tehrmari]] prison on Lo'Dahr. This prison saw very little use up until the Divine Schism, as violent crime was not a widespread issue among the Tehrmari until after their first major war. However, after the Schism, continued skirmishes between La'Tehrmari and Ro'Tehrmari forces resulted in an increasing number of Ro'Tehrmari being imprisoned, and the prison eventually began to overflow.

Some of the most infamous criminals in Tehrmari history were imprisoned here, including Kungahs, the warrior who killed [[Tehra]] and [[Amohn Aihura]].

## Points of Interest

### Heart of the Tempest

The **Heart of the Tempest** is the massive orb in the sky, which all of the clouds and islands in the region seem to be orbiting. The Heart can be accessed through a small tunnel in its northern face, which can be glided to from a tower in the north, as hinted at by the "[[The Dragonbones Stir]]" book. 

Inside this structure, players will find the skeleton of [[Palaesida]], as well as a chest which contains the [[Thundercrux]] legendary item.
