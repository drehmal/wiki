This book can be found in a chest in the [[Admin Wing|Administrative Wing of the Av'Sal Repository]]. It seems to contain the recorded thoughts of [[Ekari]], as they were imagining a design for the Ancillary Research Facility at [[Sal'Mevir]].

## Transcription
> I think, and it begins. Something alien to the landscape, yet rooted in nature. Something strong enough to support huge blocks of rehntite and currents of primal energy, yet fluid.
>
> An idea! Monumental, elegant archways of white static adorned with the vivid color of a warm Lorahn reef. I picture them arcing over a forest of conifers and the concept fully materializes.
>
> Though my mind throbs with pain at the idea of working in white yet again, I cannot help but smile at the idea of a flock of verdant snowgeese honking as they flit between domes of royal purple. Yes, this will do for the new facility. Of course, Emperor Anyr rejected my other ideas again. Is a painter forced to paint one scene over and over again really even a painter anymore? It is so stifling. Ah well. At least my sweet cat will enjoy hearing about my latest tetrahedron tree-city concept.
