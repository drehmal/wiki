## Transcription
> At last, Aryk seems to be on the right path. After escaping Rohei when the Talon cracked down prior to the Great Purge, he has been studying hard over at Ihted Academy with the Mystics. I was growing very worried, because he is approaching his two-hundredth birthday, and is aging rather badly. Thankfully, that idiotic wife of his died a couple years back. Now, without distractions, I fully expect that he will be able to gain enough acclaim among the Aspects to be able to take the Trials in time! Sons can be so headstrong. As long as he stays away from the forbidden knowledge at the top of the academy, he should be a shoo-in for an invitation!
