## Location/Summary
This book can be found on a lectern in the ruined university at [[Av'Sal]]. Within, a graduate defends their thesis to Avsohmic officials, and is offered high-level positions within the Avsohmic government.

## Transcription
> As I write this, my thesis defense is only a month away. It's already finished, but I'm still stressing. I'll be presenting it to a panel of Avsohmic Officials, with lots of very important names in attendance. I've been told that my project has attracted the focus of top government scientists.
>
> I can't believe it! The thesis defense went even better than expected, and the officials loved it. They've offered me a grant to continue my research, and even suggested high-level positions in one of the three major Avsohmic divisions, Red Dawn, Blue Exodus, or Green Serpent. I'm honored.
