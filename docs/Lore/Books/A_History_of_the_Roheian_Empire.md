### Location/Summary:
This book can be found in an item frame, at a castle in the northwestern portion of [[Nahyn's Domain]]. It describes the history of the [[Roheian Empire]], a [[Tehrmari]] political entity born from a group of people forced out of [[Naharja]].

### Transcription:
> Our history has tenuous and humble beginnings. Initially, our people lived in Naharja, but were exiled by the pious La'Tehrmari due to rebellious nature and unorthodox religious views. We settled here, and founded the Free Lands of Rohei, a sanctuary for all heterodox Tehrmari.
>
> Over time, more and more Tehrmari from varied clans came to settle in the Free Lands, and we became known as an area of great religious tolerance. However, trouble was brewing. The original clans exiled from Naharja became calcified in their bureaucracy, and began to emulate the very structures of power that drove them out of Naharja. They began to crack down on any other interpretations of the teachings of the Aspects, and instituted a state cult, defined by opposition to Maelihs, Virtuo, and Drehmal as imposters assuming the identity of the Primal Tree.
>
> After this crackdown, the Free Lands of Rohei became known as the Roheian Empire, and the republican ethos that previously characterized the Lands was replaced by brutal theocracy. This period was thankfully very short-lived, and the Empire was quickly overthrown, and religious freedom was re-instated. Controversially, the new republic refused to change the name of the state nor would they relinquish the lands conquered, and to this day we are known as the Roheian Empire. Additionally, the state cult instituted by the old Empire became the new normal, which has led to conflict with the conservative clergy of Narahja. Despite this, I see a bright future ahead for the Roheian Empire.
