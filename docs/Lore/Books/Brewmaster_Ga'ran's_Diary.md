## Transcription
> Day 1:
> ---
> "Welcome to the Shivering Pines Inn", is what I'm dreaming to say to the first guest who walks through these lonely doors. Perhaps it wasn't such a good idea to set up a tavern and lodge in the Frozen Bite, but Rihalae teaches us to spread as far as the wind carries us, and a great southern gust took me and Elmlhi here. At least for a time, we should stay.
>
> There is still so much to do, but now that these four walls are around us, I can't help but be optimistic about our fortunes here.
>
> Still, something needs to be done about our lack of clientele. Maybe before that legendary Frostfang incident these woods were a little busier, but now we seem to be mostly on our own.
>
> Day 4
> ---
> Elmlhi and I put our heads together, and we've got a plan. In order to hear the echoing of laughter in these rafters, we've decided to use our shared expertise in brewing to create a drink to rival anything the Aspects could throw together. A pity about all of those kegs of Highfall Iceberg Stout we bought on our journey....
>
> P.S. Elmlhi wanted to make sure I mentioned that buying all of that alcohol was MY decision and not hers.
>
> Day 13
> ---
> My back hurts. My legs hurt. My feet hurt. Gods, even my antlers are a little sore.
>
> We've now spent three days digging out that well, but it was all worth it. We finally have a reliable non-snow source of fresh water. I could kiss the ground. I did kiss Elmlhi. We spent a lot of time giggling like two drunk Duspians while we were lazing about together, drinking nothing but Dahroehl's finest spring water. IF we had any guests, I'm sure they would have thought we were crazy.
>
> On a slightly stranger note, I did find something while we were finishing digging that pit. It's an object which seems to contain a great, but mysterious power. I decided to put it away for safe keeping in the secret loft. I'd better not write down where the entrance is, just in case one of our guests traipses up here and happens to steal a glance at this diary.
>
> Day 52
> ---
> Work, work, work. That's all there is for me these days. We just got a new party up from some land far to the West looking for our specialty, Logger's Lager. Although I probably won't have a lot of time to keep this journal up to date, I do want to proudly announce that everything is coming up Ga'ran and Elmlhi these days.
>
> Not only is our little inn bursting at the seams with guests and good cheer, but we are feeling more creative and productive than ever.
>
> I'm confident that any returning visitor to the Shivering Pines will have a new beverage to try and plenty of good company awaiting her as soon as she steps inside our cozy doors.
>
> P.S. Elmlhi wants me to mention that she's working on the "Northern Porter".
