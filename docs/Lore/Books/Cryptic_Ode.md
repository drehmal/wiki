> How splendidly your scales must shine!
>

>
> And not a hint of brine!
>
> Progenitor of morning dew
>
> No expense has been spared to honor you!
>
> Within this place there number three
>
> Artifacts of primal energy!
>
> Through your instruction, we thoroughly know
>
> That no place is free from the water's flow.
>
> Thus, so no outsiders who would poison springs
>
> Can find their way to these valuable things
>
> We shall provide only the smallest quantum of direction:
> ***
> When looking from a lower view
>
> Banners grace a rounded edge
>
> See their colors: orange and blue
>
> Hanging below the highest ledge!
>
> If a catalyst is what you seek to attain
>
> Do not halt or falter
>
> Look to the chamber marked with the sigil of rain
>
> Find the spring which feeds the altar!
>
> Next, return to the central room
>
> And find the symbol of a basin
>
> If you then look high
>
> At a reddened eye
>
> Your quest will swiftly hasten!
>
> Finally, return once more
>
> To our reverent temple's core
>
> Locate the flower and chalice of power
>

> In each of these rooms there hides one switch
>
> Within a shadowed nook
>
> Asymmetry will show you which
>
> Flow quickly betwixt them like a brook!
>
> Then return to the central pool to claim your final offering.
