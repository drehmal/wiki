## Layout/Points of Interest

The town is built in a similar manner to the [[Merijool#Arijoor Forks|Arijoor Forks]], with large flat terraces supported by stone walls, although more buildings still stand in this ruin than that one.

An ice sculpture of unknown significance, possibly meant to depict [[Loe]], is found in the western portion of the town.

Near this statue, to the north, a building has a small 1.5-block tall hallway. A hidden room behind a chiseled stone brick in this hallway holds the [[Artifacts#Loe'Othrah|Loe'Othrah]] artifact, a Silk Touch iron pick.

A pyramid to the northeast holds two spawners and loot chests: one skeleton spawner and one zombie.

## Lore

Very little lore is known on Kamt, but it is very likely due to their position in Eastern Merijool that they were worshippers of [[Loe]], Aspect of Cold.

This town may have been hit very hard by the [[Frostfang Catastrophe]], possibly leading to its current state of abandonment.
