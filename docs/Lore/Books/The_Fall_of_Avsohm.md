## Transcription
> Avsohm saw much diplomatic success under Drehn's reign, but his life was untimely cut short during a devastating plague. This coincided with a major decline in stability, exemplified by the rulers that followed. Drehn's successor was Emperor Zorhis Ifeihl. Although massively popular, especially with younger generations, he fell out of favor due to disastrous war with the Tri-Moon Theocracy and consistent economic mismanagement. Ifeihl's successor would be Avsohm's last emperor, Uffeihl Anyr. Emperor Anyr was also loved by the people, as he was a great war hero, in contrast to the "soft" perception many had of Ifeihl. The growing threat of an invasion by the forces of Mael allowed Emperor Anyr to conduct military tactics that would be seen as outrageous today. For example, he transferred himself and his cabinet to the city of Sal'Anyr west of the Tharxax Plains. Avsohm met its end after a mysterious event resulted in the disappearance of many of the empire's military and industrial leaders. Mael took this moment of chaos to invade, and was successfully able to conquer all of the West. The remnants of Avsohm's great magical prowess have been left to gather dust in the wake of its collapse.
