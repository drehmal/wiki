## Transcription
> I cannot stop now.
>
> But I cannot press on for much longer: I have lost the strength to carry my equipment any further.
>
> So thus I must write.
>
> My name is Vahrim. I was once a monk of Virtuo who lived in the peaceful and naive town of Gozak.
>
> I have always been a voracious reader. From the ancient Tehrmari sages, to the great works of Teiruun, I greedily devour any books I can get my hands onto.
>
> And I have discovered a truth which shook the foundations of my faith.
>
> Virtuo is an imposter. A lying snake. She abandoned us after the Tidal War and seeks only her own peace, purity, or perfection.
>
> Although I had begun to have doubts, the final straw came in a tome from the Palisades, written by the ancient Drehua.
>
> Although the words were cryptic, one thing was clear. It was a people called the Viruhn which were the cause of Maehlis's birth in agony. The resemblance in name to the Goddess is
the proof that I had been badly misguided in my faith.
>
> So I ventured to the Carmine, and visited the Sepulchral Altar at Rhaveloth. And there, I learned about the greatness of Maehlis and his mission.
>
> Unlike Virtuo, Maehlis cares for the people of this realm. He seeks to unite by fire. Burning our skin to a char is his way of making our exteriors a reflection of our imperfection.
>
> We cannot be peaceful, pure, or perfect, so why should we try? The Maelmari priests heard my yearning call and generously told me all they knew.
>
> Now I must complete my journey to the south-west. I will not stop until I reach the Titans of Strength and Servitude at the mouth of the Hellcrags. Only then can I become a true
Drehmari prophet of Maelihs.
>
> If some traveler miraculously comes upon my encampment, please take this journal and continue my mission.
>
> The world must learn about the greatness of Maehlis. If this realm is doomed, let us spend our waning years under the tutelage of a deity who will care for us.
