## Transcription
> It was the survey drones who found it, I heard.
>
> Everyone knew the rumors. Featherless birds, twisted and three-eyed.
>
> Fish that sought the land and rotted where they landed.
>
> Fields of reeds with underground maws to swallow the feet of passers-by.
>
> And yet there it was: the lilting song of energy for the empire.
>
> The expeditionary force rode north as far as the land would go.
>
> But were stopped by the proud and foolish northern clans
>
> Unswayed by Drehn, the clans barred the path
>
> But later perished at the hands of their hero
>
> Along with all life in that endless plain.
>
> An eternal fury of malevolent ice
>
> Spiraling and spreading like ash from a pyre
>
> Yet serendipitous! For passage to the mountain was found.
>
> And collection began its frenzied refrain.
>
> But rumors from that place persist, of oozing stone
>
> And tumors of alien tissue.
>
> Though comfortable now in fair Av’Sal
>
> Maybe we should not have gone there at all.
