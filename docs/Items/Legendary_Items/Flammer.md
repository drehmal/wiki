The **Flammer** is one of 30 Legendary Items obtainable in Drehmal: Apotheosis.

Primarily functioning as a pickaxe which can mine multiple blocks at a time, the Flammer is technically a legendary weapon as well, dealing moderate damage as a heavy weapon. It is found in [[Mt. Ebonfire]].

## Gameplay
Flammer is an NBT-modified wooden pickaxe. This means that it inherits some of the base traits of a wooden pickaxe, such as its very low durability and the set of blocks that it can successfully break.

Flammer has some utility as a weapon, dealing 8 attack damage with 1.2 attack speed, not far off from some of the weaker dedicated legendary weapons. Its Fire Aspect I and Knockback I enchantments, which would not normally be supported by a pickaxe, add to its use as a weapon.

However, the primary use of Flammer is for its special ability, which allows the tool to mine in a 3x3 block grid. This ability is only applied when the block targeted is a block with WOODEN pickaxe affinity (broken most quickly by a pick and not an axe, shovel, hoe, or other tool), such as stone. If the central block in the 3x3 grid is, for example, dirt or wood, which are designed to be broken with shovels and axes respectively, then only that one block will be broken. Additionally, if the ability is activated but one of the 9 blocks in the 3x3 grid are not a pickaxe-minable block, it will not be broken by the ability.

Excavation Torch therefore breaks all stone-type blocks in a 1-block radius of a stone-type block it is used to mine, up to 9 blocks in a 3x3 grid. The orientation of this grid is determined by the face of the block targeted by the pickaxe. If the block is mined from the top or bottom, then a 1-block deep grid, 3 blocks wide in the X and Z axes, is dug. If a block is targeted from the side, then it will form a 3-block tall grid, extending out 1 block to either side of the central block.

Of note, even though Flammer is quite powerful, it is still a wooden pickaxe at baseline. Thus, blocks that are not dropped when mined by a wooden pickaxe will either not be recognized as a valid target for Flammer's ability (such as a diamond block) or will be broken but not dropped (such as obsidian).

## How to Obtain
Flammer is located in a mineshaft in [[Mt. Ebonfire]], on the mountain proper.

The entrance to this mineshaft is found south-southwest of the mountain's summit. Immediately after entering the mineshaft, turning right will take the player to a slightly hidden staircase, leading to a longer series of descending ladders. After making the way past spider spawners and cobwebbed platforms, Flammer can be found in a trapped chest at the bottom level.

## Lore
Flammer is an experimental mining tool developed by [[Red Dawn]], and still in use today by the workers living under [[Maelihs]] at the town of [[Ebonrun]]. As mentioned by the book [[Spider Infestation]], found in that town, the tool was accidentally left behind as the miners fled from the spiders that now inhabit the cave.
