# Kahmas Tuhs

**Kahmas Tuhs** was an elite [[Avsohm|Avsohmic]] general, and the head of [[Blue Exodus]]. He was frozen in temporal stasis at the [[Stasis Facility]], and his pod appears to have opened several years before the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Stasis_Eight/). It is unclear if he is still alive somewhere in the realm.

## History

Kahmas was a long-lived Drehmari, born during the late reign of [[Drehn]] and being an active force in Avsohmic politics through the reigns of [[Ifeihl]] and [[Anyr]]. His first known escapades were in the [[Divine Schism]], where he was personally hand-picked by Glacial Elder [[Loe]] to lead an Anti-Palaesidan siege of the Aspects' palace, serving as a leader in that army despite being one of the very few non-[[Tehrmari]] involved in the conflict.

Kahmas arose to become the Commander of the military organization [[Blue Exodus]] at some point, and appears to have held this position at the time of Avsohm's fall in Av2 1820, nearly 200 years after his service in the Schism. 

Kahmas appears to have had a significant role in the forging of the [[Mythbreaker]], especially in its separation and containment following the actual process. There are records of him visiting several Avsohmic facilities, as his name appears frequently on holotexts in story locations, including [[Exodus Vault]], [[Av'Sal]], and the [[Numencore]].

Just prior to the [[Fall of Avsohm]], Kahmas was one of the important Avsohmic officers who was brought to the [[Stasis Facility]] and frozen in time as the empire collapsed. He was located in Pod #10.

## Stasis

Based on a [[stasis_info.md|holotext in the Stasis Facility]], it appears that Kahmas' pod was opened first, 17 years before the [Stasis Eight](/Lore/Historical_Figures/Stasis_Eight/). In-game, his pod is open and empty. There is no clear information concerning to what happened to Kahmas, whether he is still alive somewhere or even managed to make it out of the facility.


## Extras

In July 2025, co-lead developer DomeMaster revealed that Kahmas Tuhs was, in fact, a [[Virmari]]. While this information is not corroborated anywhere in 2.2, it is possible that his character may be expanded upon in future updates.
