**Those Beyond**, also known simply as "The Orbs", are bizarre creatures which appear as dark spheres, and are capable of consuming physical matter by chewing 'perfectly circular holes' through it. Most accounts describe a death to Those Beyond as people being riddled with perfectly circular holes from an unseen source, until they simply cease to exist.

## In-Map References

The only known sightings of Those Beyond were within [[Mt. Yavhlix]], in Eastern [[Xivrhynt]], and in various Avsohmic facilities during the [[Fall of Avsohm]], being the method through which much of the empire's top brass was destroyed. They are believed to be creatures that reside beyond the [[Veil]], only allowed into the realm by tears in the fabric of space and time.

The name "Those Beyond" comes from [[The Facets|Facet II]], which describes the [[Fall of Avsohm]] and contains this line:

> 2:2 - And Those Beyond will enter, perfect and circular. They will devour all in their path. They will even consume themselves.

This lines up closely with other depictions of the orbs.

When Avsohm made their [[Expedition Team Log|trip to Eastern Xivrhynt]] and discovered the ruins of the Bright Capital, they were accosted by Those Beyond, forcing them to abandon the mission:

> I am writing this final report with regret. Only 4 of the 15 original expedition team survived the encounter. Inverse black orbs from across the split hills came straight for us, consuming all that they touched. We’re lucky that we were able to make it to the shore and our ship alive. Luckily, we have more than enough supplies for the trip back, but morale is low.

Several [holotexts inside the Primary Energy Collection Facility](/Story_and_Features/Holotexts/Mt._Yavhlix_Dungeon/) reference Those Beyond, and even seem to have holes chewed through them by the creatures as well, redacting certain words and sometimes even most of the message.

Due to the contents of the [[yav_hole|"Beyond" holotext]], Those Beyond are believed to be associated with the [[Alchemy#Eidolic Whispers|Eidolic Whispers]] heard by alchemists.
